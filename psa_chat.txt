3/21/23, 10:58 AM - Hasan Zulfiqar: Salaam,
Thank you to everyone who came to our dinner with India Club, we saw over 250 guests attend. I saw lots of new faces as well as familiar ones. 

We have one event left in the semester and it is the seminar with the US Department of State on April 17th @5pm. A range of topics will be covered such as growing up here post 9/11, learning to navigate the ropes of the real world as a first generation student, needs of international students, assimilation vs syncretism and the desire to stay close to your culture all the while fitting in, and many more similar topics. I will send the sign up link and flyer once we are closer to the event.

Secondly, everyone has been asking about their PSA shirts. They have been ordered and are in production right now, they should arrive around Eid which will be my Eidi to y’all.

Lastly, we have openings for next year’s board. As much of a dictator I am, I will not be rerunning as I want a group with a fresh set of ideas to run the PSA. Apply to be on board here: https://forms.gle/XiDQBphtRmQ7QkUq5

"
A Pakistani grad student at Indiana University desperately needs help. 
His parents are stranded at the airport since they missed their flight to Pakistan. The couple is old and cannot communicate very well. He’s ideally looking for a family who can host them for the night but any help at this point is greatly appreciated.
Thank you!Thank you!

Assalamoalaikum everyone. As you may know the Muslim Student Association board member voting ends tonight. Since many PSA members are also MSA members, I’d like to remind you guys that Rameez Raoof, our current president, is running for MSA treasurer next year. Rameez has shown a lot of dedication to the PSA over the last 2 years and he would be an amazing addition to the MSA Board. 

Furthermore, Tahir Saied is running for PnI Chair (Philanthropy and Interfaith). Tahir (learning urdu) is an honorary Pakistani and has been one of the most helpful volunteers in PSA’s events. You can even ask him to sing your favorite naats such as tajdar e haram. Furthermore as a Hafiz of the Holy Quran he is the man for the job considering the importance of the PnI Committee. Make sure to support our own Rameez and Tahir for MSA board positions for next year InshaAllah so that the PSA can continue collabing with them and having even better events for us in the future. 

Voting ending tonight please show support!! 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰

4/29/24, 1:07 AM - Meta AI: I'd be happy to translate text from one language to another. Please provide the text you want to translate, the original language, and the language you want to translate it to.

Example: "Hello, how are you?" (English) to Spanish

I'll respond with the translation: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" (Spanish)

Go ahead and provide the text you'd like me to translate!
4/29/24, 1:07 AM - Hamzah Zahid: @13135550002 আমি লাউ খাই
4/29/24, 1:07 AM - Meta AI: The text "আমি লাউ খাই" is in Bengali, and it translates to "I eat gourds" or "I like to eat gourds" in English.

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

- আমি (Ami) = I
- লাউ (Lau) = gourds
- খাই (Khái) = eat (or like to eat)

Let me know if you have any other sentences you'd like me to translate!

I am still improving my command of non-English languages, and I may make errors while attempting them. I will be most useful to you if I can assist you in English.

4/29/24, 6:26 AM - +971 58 127 8940: As the PSA president at American University Dubai (@psa.aud) and a current exchange student at GT, I highly recommend Safiy for the Secretary position. He possesses exceptional communication, management skills, and unwavering dedication. Safiy's moral integrity adds depth to his leadership. His passion for Pakistan and PSA, coupled with his extensive network and stellar academic performance, make him invaluable. With prior management experience and a profound understanding of the Pakistani community at Georgia Tech, Safiy is well-equipped for the role. Additionally, his acceptance of a high-ranking internship at NVIDIA showcases his competency and connectivity. Safiy's inclusive mindset and multifaceted approach will undoubtedly contribute to PSA's success. I hope you all the best and a great election 😊☺️🥳

6/9/24, 4:12 PM - Sualeh Syed: Let me be Pakistan president. I have this really great idea that if we sell all of our civilian electricity off we can make a lot of money. Matter of fact sell the copper wires and replace with aluminum. I'm sure nothing will go wrong

6/9/24, 4:22 PM - Sualeh Syed: Yeah, it's my favorite place tbh
6/9/24, 4:22 PM - Shayan Waqar: Who said that? Brother…
6/9/24, 4:23 PM - Shayan Waqar: Man taking things out of context
6/9/24, 4:23 PM - Sualeh Syed: Well when you're illegal and the only way you have to make money is that, you sort of have to get exploited
6/9/24, 4:23 PM - Shayan Waqar: Bro I was studying for an exam once and like halfway through the grind bro tells me he’s a Zionist
6/9/24, 4:23 PM - Sualeh Syed: This message was deleted
6/9/24, 4:24 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: True but that doesn’t mean it’s okay. Just like if you’re a civilian in a war zone then I guess “you have to die”
6/9/24, 4:24 PM - Shayan Waqar: Bro I got some muzzies to debate and cook him. He just left <This message was edited>
6/9/24, 4:24 PM - Sualeh Syed: Oh sure, I agree with that
6/9/24, 4:24 PM - Sualeh Syed: 100%
6/9/24, 4:24 PM - Sualeh Syed: But
6/9/24, 4:24 PM - Sualeh Syed: You reap what you sow
6/9/24, 4:25 PM - Shayan Waqar: I think u guys have the same point but you’re not getting it
6/9/24, 4:25 PM - Shayan Waqar: U both literally agree with each other
6/9/24, 4:25 PM - Sualeh Syed: This message was deleted
6/9/24, 4:25 PM - Sualeh Syed: Ngl I probably get arrested if these chats get leaked
6/9/24, 4:26 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: All I’m saying is don’t justify exploitation. Blaming the victim in any scenario is not productive.
6/9/24, 4:26 PM - Sualeh Syed: Difference in perception of who's the victim
6/9/24, 4:27 PM - Sualeh Syed: If I tell you, don't come here without signing some papers or it's going to suck, and you still come here. It's on you🤷
6/9/24, 4:27 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: True they made that choice. But the people exploiting them made the choice too and I think that is worse.
6/9/24, 4:28 PM - Sualeh Syed: Yeah it's not okay to exploit people, but people will be people
6/9/24, 4:28 PM - Sualeh Syed: Humans suck when they're put in positions of power
6/9/24, 4:29 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: I agree on that. But let’s not be pessimistic to the point where we’re numb to all the wrong that happens.
6/9/24, 4:30 PM - Sualeh Syed: Yeah I'm not saying that either lol. I'm simply stating that it happens. Nothing more.
6/9/24, 4:31 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Yes that’s true it happens. None of it is okay.
6/9/24, 4:39 PM - Shayan Waqar: idk how yall managed to debate against each other while proving the same point
6/9/24, 4:39 PM - Usama: There’s actually a connection between Dubai and Pakistan cricket. A man who’s been named in Dubai leaks is currently running Pakistan Cricket Board.
6/9/24, 4:39 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: The points were different. We just agreed to something in the end.
6/9/24, 4:40 PM - Shayan Waqar: I mean idt Sualeh said it was okay for workers to be exploited at any point
6/9/24, 4:41 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: He said they chose to illegally immigrate, which insinuates it was their fault, at least partly, that they’re being exploited <This message was edited>
6/9/24, 4:56 PM - Sualeh Syed: Yes
6/9/24, 5:22 PM - +1 (470) 301-1134: Wait what are we talking about lol its getting heated here

6/24/24, 10:32 PM - Usama: Afg have already batted first so  now if Ban take more than 13 overs to chase it down, Aus qualify, knocking out both Afg and Ban. <This message was edited>
6/24/24, 10:40 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: Yeah, this was the scenario actually

6/25/24, 1:16 AM - Rameez Raoof: Why is it always such a bad performance by Bangladesh and a not great performance by Afghanistan 😢
6/25/24, 1:17 AM - +1 (770) 286-1701: In order to lose while chasing 115 a team has to rely for the opponent to play badly
6/25/24, 1:17 AM - +1 (770) 286-1701: Bangladesh gave up their own semi finals interest quite early
6/25/24, 1:17 AM - Rameez Raoof: Afghanistan is just that good bro
6/25/24, 1:17 AM - +1 (770) 286-1701: Yea but not at there very best today during some time of the game

6/25/24, 1:19 AM - Rameez Raoof: Does that mean the match was pakistan vs pakistan?
6/25/24, 1:20 AM - Usama: Naya Pakistan vs East Pakistan
6/25/24, 1:23 AM - Usama: Yeah but they should stop sucking up to India while playing against them. Like seriously 😁
6/25/24, 1:26 AM - +1 (770) 286-1701: That's the most pakistani trait they have
6/25/24, 1:34 AM - +1 (404) 993-5642: Pitch is quite tough
6/25/24, 1:34 AM - +1 (404) 993-5642: Average score on the pitch is like 130
6/25/24, 1:34 AM - +1 (404) 993-5642: It's not as bad of a performance as people are making it seem
6/25/24, 1:34 AM - +1 (404) 993-5642: They had to play risky because they had to chase 115 in 13 overs and so they lost a lot of wickets early as a result <This message was edited>

7/3/24, 7:26 PM - +1 (678) 622-4355: it’s crazy to think how much potential pakistan had and the amount of opportunity there was
7/3/24, 7:26 PM - +1 (678) 622-4355: fastest growing economy in asia in the 60’s and 70’s

7/3/24, 7:40 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: Not anymore, cause it's the same old script.
7/3/24, 7:41 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: Know a Pakistani who got invited by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work for them.
7/3/24, 7:43 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: I know a Pakistani who’s a professor of economics at Princeton and was also part of the economic advisory council of Pakistan. They kicked him out of the EAC tho.
7/3/24, 7:45 PM - Usama: That was mostly artificial economy with loads of uncle Sam’s money flowing in as a reward for joining his bloc
7/3/24, 7:45 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: I mean what can you expect from a country whose space agency is led by a retired army officer
7/3/24, 7:46 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Or where a mechanical engineering degree gets you 40k PKR per month

7/3/24, 7:57 PM - Tawhid: pakistan zindabad
7/3/24, 7:59 PM - Zaeem Ahmad: You gotta listen to the lyrics he’s talking about politics no one understood what he meant back then. He basically predicted Pakistans future
7/3/24, 8:29 PM - Usama: Yeah things have gotten worse more recently but the country has been on this trajectory for the past 50 years. If I were to point out two problems that are the root of all problems, one would be feudalism which we could never get rid of because it’s partially rooted in Pak’s creation. The other one would be the curse of Pak’s geographical location where it’s a tempting battleground for too many global powers for influence in the region.
7/3/24, 8:32 PM - +1 (678) 622-4355: i’d say geographical location is the biggest factor. partition, then the wars with india, then dealing with afghanistan, then iran, then war on terror. pak hasn’t been able to catch a break. and then leadership, well, yk…
7/3/24, 8:33 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: We could've used our geographical position to our advantage had our politicianscbe a diplomat diplomat
7/3/24, 8:34 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Add elite capture to the list
7/3/24, 8:34 PM - +1 (678) 622-4355: elaborate on that cuz i haven’t seen that lens before
7/3/24, 8:35 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: I mean as in how India plays the game
7/3/24, 8:35 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: They got good ties with russia, iran, and the us
7/3/24, 8:36 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: All at the same time. They import russian oil, while also attracting more American companies and start ups to their country.
7/3/24, 8:36 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Afghanistan issue was Zia’s fault. We have a lot of natural resources especially in Balochistan. But we’re unable to leverage natural resources because of incompetence. Take Reko Diq gold mines for example.
7/3/24, 8:36 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: All of that without the fear of sanctions or being pressurised
7/3/24, 8:36 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: But yes geography is still bad cuz we’re surrounded by enemies and India can easily cut off our trade routes and water supply.
7/3/24, 8:37 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Our only advantage is our border with China
7/3/24, 8:37 PM - +1 (678) 622-4355: that’s why china keeps us around. they have heavy investments in balochistan
7/3/24, 8:39 PM - Sualeh Syed: Politicians are corrupt, divides among people are more prevalent than ever. Even if Pakistan wanted to take advantage of any of the mentioned situations they wouldn't be able to.
7/3/24, 8:41 PM - +1 (678) 622-4355: yep, all comes back down our govt selling us out any chance they get and tribalism between the different provinces
7/3/24, 8:46 PM - Usama: All these are small problems. The real issue is that the political and governance systems are never allowed to function consistently for an extended period due to the two problems I mentioned earlier.
7/3/24, 9:11 PM - Usama: Most of the elite is feudal lords

8/13/24, 4:16 PM - Tahir Saied: And if you ask them, they will surely say, We were only conversing and playing. Say, Is it Allāh and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? (9:65)

8/13/24, 4:18 PM - Sualeh Syed: Free mixing is undoubtedly Haram. There is no argument regarding it. If you are Muslim you believe it is Haram. Of course, I joked about it, but there's truth behind the joke.

8/13/24, 4:23 PM - Sualeh Syed: What's the question

8/14/24, 9:21 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: But we’re all educated here so I don’t think this is the right place to advocate against it or discuss it for that matter.
8/14/24, 9:21 PM - Zaeem Ahmad: Ifaz asking the real questions
8/14/24, 9:22 PM - +1 (470) 569-2697: I would refrain from describing it itself as a problem since this is something that Allah has made halal
8/14/24, 9:22 PM - Nabeel Hossain: All the real questions keep getting deleted 😭
8/14/24, 9:22 PM - +1 (470) 569-2697: However it is valid to say that repeated marriages can lead to problems

8/14/24, 9:23 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: True but Allah has given us the ability to critically think and use that ability where something isn’t explicitly mentioned. It’s the same thing as avoiding something that is clearly known to be causing cancer.

8/14/24, 9:25 PM - +1 (470) 569-2697: To say cousin marriage as a whole is bad would but unfair

8/30/24, 11:47 AM - +1 (470) 929-0660: BLA = Balochistan Liberation Army. It’s an ethnic separatist movement for Balochistan. They killed a bus full of 21 Punjabis recently. BLA exists because Balochistan has been historically neglected and barely funded by the federal government. The army has been harassing innocent civilians in Balochistan and engaging in enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Some believe that BLA is actually an army project to divide the people and allow them to continue serving themselves and their allies (businessmen, politicians, bureaucrats) interests in the region. Now what seems likely is that this BLA is a false flag operation to allow the army to sell off this mine and if anyone in Balochistan speaks out against it, they can flag it as terrorism and gain support of the people in more extrajudicial killings and oppression.

There are some cosmetic issues and the power steering has a leak. 

I think $1500 is a fair price. If you have the patience (or the good affordable car mechanic) to fix the rack and pinion or live with it, it’s yours!

9/13/24, 11:28 AM - Shayan Waqar: This happened at a factory in Sialkot last year too. An employee from Sri Lanka was killed by employees there and in their heads they had done a good thing because they killed someone accused of blasphemy. They were arrested and prosecuted eventually so the justice system didn’t fail non-Muslims in our country in that case at least
9/13/24, 11:30 AM - Shayan Waqar: But there is definitely a lot of misinformation and lack of information among the general public especially in smaller cities where in several cases people don’t actually understand Sharia <This message was edited>
9/13/24, 11:30 AM - Mirza Zuhayr: 4 witnesses man
9/13/24, 11:33 AM - Shayan Waqar: So in the factory case what happened was that he was a foreigner that didn’t understand Urdu or Arabic script so he took a poster off the wall that spoke about the Prophet SAW without understanding what it was and people got mad over it. So like there were definitely tons of witnesses but the man wasn’t given a proper trial or hearing in court for a judge to decide what to do. The several “witnesses” / factory staff just took it into their own hands
9/13/24, 11:34 AM - +1 (678) 622-4355: it’s sad bro. our issues are rooted much deeper than just fauj. so much misinformation and ignorance in the common man. when they themselves don’t understand basic sharia of their own country how can we expect anything to get better

9/13/24, 1:34 PM - Usama: Emotions and ignorance certainly have a lot to do with such incidents. Mob lynchers think that even if punished, they’ll die as heroes and will be rewarded in the Hereafter.
9/13/24, 1:35 PM - Usama: But the heart of the problem is that the state has failed to enforce the rule of law and ensure justice across the board. Nobody trusts the judicial system. In general, one can commit a serious crime and still find a way to escape punishment. This tempts people to take the law into their own hands to enforce justice themselves. However, the issue of blasphemy is somewhat unique because there is a large, influential group that tends to glorify the lynchers. The lynchers subconsciously believe they got the public support and can evade punishment later with enough public pressure.
9/13/24, 1:36 PM - Usama: Ironically, this creates a vicious cycle: People take the law into their own hands because they don’t trust the justice system, hoping they can escape punishment later because the justice system is weak.
9/13/24, 1:40 PM - Usama: Happy to take the discussion to the DMs though 😁
9/13/24, 1:45 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: The problem is in the law itself too. Who decides what is blasphemy and what isn’t. It’s not just lynching but also innocent people kept in prison for years because of false accusations. And blasphemy only applies to one religion? So we get a free pass to mock other religions as we please. But god forbid anyone criticize us. 

Overall though, restricting freedom of speech or expression is a slippery slope especially in a fascist regime. Anyone who’s read 1984 and has seen the current situation of the country knows why. Personally, I think the law should be repealed. No one should be killed over what they say.

9/13/24, 9:10 PM - Hamzah Zahid: Diguising the disrespect of the most beloved person to more than a billion people as free speech is a very hollow and superficial statement.
If someone disrespects your parents in front of you, no one is going to call it free speech, or a dilemma as to whether it can be considered as "disrespect".
The problem is not in the law. The problem is with the justice system's execution of the law and a lack of literacy within the average Pakistani who is on top frustrated due to a lot of socioeconomical reasons that then succumbs to mob mentality and vigilantism. Vigilantism is the problem, not the law. 

And this law exists for all organized religions under the constitution in Pak, not just Islam.
9/13/24, 9:23 PM - Tahir Saied: Agreed, it can't be a coincidence that the most morally degenerate countries tend to be the ones without blasphemy laws

9/13/24, 10:12 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Under no circumstances am I saying it is morally okay to commit blasphemy even under free speech. However, having seen my country become a dictatorship, I would much rather err on the side of less censorship. The problem lies within the law and whatever interpretation led to it. And not to mention the nation in which the laws are being implemented. A lot of countries do well with blasphemy laws as they have other laws in place to balance things while also having an educated population who will not misinterpret the slightest thing as blasphemy. 

Now Pakistan on the other hand has a flawed justice system and an uneducated population as you mentioned. Which is why we cannot implement this law until we solve the above problems. 

As for how the law is implemented, I disagree with the death penalty. I disagree with imprisoning people without solid evidence. I do not think criticisms of any belief come under blasphemy. When it comes to people disrespecting my parents, it would anger me but I don’t think it warrants death. I do think inciting hatred towards people of a particular belief or damaging religious sites should be punished appropriately.

And this law is rife with potential for misuse. Whether it is for personal enmity, against activists or political opponents.

And this law was not brought about to promote moral stability. It was brought about with the intention of pleasing the crowd that supports extremism and persecution of minorities. Had the blasphemy laws pre-Zia stayed the same, we might have suffered less problems.
9/13/24, 10:15 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Countries with blasphemy laws have equal if not more moral degeneracy. Corruption and bribery replace drinking and partying. Innocent people are abducted, silenced and murdered. Nothing changes.

9/14/24, 11:26 AM - +1 (470) 929-0660: I don’t want to hurt anyone’s religious sentiments so I will not go into debate on jurist interpretations. I do not support or encourage blasphemy. I do not endorse insult of the Prophet (SAW) to be taken lightly and in fact any religious figure of any religion. My statements are not in criticism of religion but of a law that has been misused and weaponized. A law that may have basis in divine scripture but has been interpreted and written (in the penal code) by men. Had the law been written as the words of the Holy Quran or Sahih Hadith verbatim with full context, I would not challenge it. 

The problem lies in misuse of a law due to its vagueness in where we draw the line for example. Junaid Hafeez and Asia Bibi are two prime examples of unjust imprisonment under the law. People have been imprisoned over mere criticism of the laws implemented by the government of Pakistan. Our lawmakers support murder (https://www.dawn.com/news/1858556).

To clarify on my statements regarding criticism of religion not coming under blasphemy, I meant criticism constructive to a debate. Not mockery or disrespect. People should be allowed to disagree with your beliefs. Healthy debate and questioning should not be discouraged for religion.

I apologize if anyones religious sentiments were hurt by my views. I have no intention to insult anyone’s beliefs. I only voiced humanitarian concerns regarding a law. Despite my advocacy against government censorship, I strongly oppose hateful speech directed towards any religion, race, ethnicity or gender.
9/14/24, 12:07 PM - +1 (678) 557-8563: Salman Taseer was a government official who was shot in broad daylight for trying to modify the law, and limit its abuse by the Muslim majority in Pakistan. 

Mobs celebrated and garnered in roses the person who shot Salman Taseer in public daylight. 

I think we, being privileged enough to be educated, need to be forward thinking enough to know our country/society needs MAJOR reform. 

I am born and raised in Pakistan. Although the blasphemy laws there are theoretically supposed to discourage disrespect against all religions, it is mainly and overwhelmingly only used to punish non-Muslims in personal/professional disputes. It further marginalizes our already marginalized non-Sunni communities. 

I think we can agree our social fabric needs work.
9/14/24, 12:17 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Also progressive Muslims, liberals, socialists, secularists and anyone who disagrees with the status quo are targeted. Mashal Khan and Junaid Hafeez were only guilty of being liberals and socialists.

We need to counter the ever-growing radicalism within our population in order to progress.

9/14/24, 2:13 PM - Usama: Yes and it’s important to emphasize that mistrust in the judicial system, due to corruption and incompetence, is the root cause of the problem. Yes, you can modify laws and educate people, but when laws aren’t strictly enforced across the board, criminals continue to evade punishment for any crime, and law enforcement agencies fail to provide safety and security, even the most educated and tolerant individuals may be tempted to take the law into their own hands because, deep down, it’s in our human nature to seek and enforce justice as we perceive it.
9/14/24, 2:19 PM - +1 (404) 203-9056: Exactly. What hope can a minority group have when Natasha can get away so easily with killing an innocent daughter and father? As someone said, "You don't have to buy a lawyer in this country, you just have to buy the judge."
9/14/24, 2:24 PM - Subhan Ali Arshad: Best explanation. Ma Shaa Allah. A great example is actually at the very top. When one party governs, it puts its supporters, who were under investigation for corruption or another crime, on bail and they can then flee the country or later be cleared of charges. Both sides use this tactic and how frustrating it is for the people. If you put yourself in their shoes, surely you can see why some believe such justice system will never be fixed
9/14/24, 2:27 PM - +1 (470) 929-0660: Agreed. However, it was the law that let her get away. https://www.dawn.com/news/1043236. Which is again why we need reform. Otherwise we will have more cases like her and shahrukh jatoi. The value of a single human life in Pakistan is $80k which is less than two years of college for an international student. https://dunyanews.tv/amp/english/835686.php

This year, one of PSA’s goals is to increase our presence on campus. We need to start showing Georgia Tech our established presence so that we can expand our scope on campus.

Make sure to register as a member of PSA on Engage, which is Georgia Tech’s Student Club Hub, so we can make a difference on campus.
