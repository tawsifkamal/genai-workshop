[2023-11-24, 7:35:18 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Jummah Gem:

When we see others suffering, sometimes we feel guilty and undeserving of our blessings and subsequently hesitant to express gratitude. However, this response takes us further away from Allah. Gratitude is mentioned frequently in the Qur'an and is meant to be part of our regular worship. In fact, praising Allah in awe and out of gratitude is right at the start of the verses we say daily in our prayers in Surah Fatiha.

Another key benefit of gratitude, specifically in regards to the guilt we feel for those suffering, is that Allah increases us when we are grateful. In verse 7 of Surah Ibrahim, He says, "And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, 'If you are grateful, I will surely increase you; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe.'" When our blessings increase, we have more to help others with. Perhaps the best way to express gratitude is just that--using our blessings to serve others in need.

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

If you are able to donate to a runner’s page through this link, it would be greatly appreciated- all money is going towards aid for gaza!

Also it is not too late to join as a runner! This can be a way to get back in shape during winter break while also raising money for a good cause! If interested be sure to join the chat! https://chat.whatsapp.com/DyQpX66tfFe9QQrcmVNtg2

[2023-12-01, 12:58:15 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Jummah Gem:

"I'd like us to understand resistance as the way we use our everyday lives to exert energy against the dangerous status quo of our time. But resistance cannot only be about what we are against. When we choose to resist something or someone, we are also choosing something else on the other side. Perhaps we are choosing ourselves; perhaps we are choosing an inclusive love or a more just society. We resist ableism or racism because we know there is a better way--this is the way resistance works, and we must both find and create that better way together." -Kaitlin B. Curtice, Living Resistance: An Indigenous Vision for Seeking Wholeness Every Day

Allah details in the Qur'an what is truly forbidden and should be resisted, and the good that we can choose instead.

"Say, Who has forbidden the adornment from Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good things of provision? Say, They are for those who believed during the life of this world, exclusively [for them] on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We detail the verses for a people who know. Say, My Lord has only forbidden immoralities--what is apparent of them and what is concealed--and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about Allah that which you do not know." Qur'an, 7:32-33

Let's resist the forbidden deeds and choose what's better for ourselves and humanity.

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

Venmo: @GTMSA-Finance
Zelle: gtechmsa.finance@gmail.com

We will be accepting donations until midnight tonight. If everyone in the chat could contribute even $1, we can easily exceed this goal inshallah. Jazakallahu khairan for your continued support
[2023-12-04, 3:53:05 PM] Muadh: Hello, I’m a constituent of Representative _____. I’m calling regarding House Resolution 894 that will be voted on tonight — I’m urging Representative ___ to vote no on this resolution. It equates antisemitism with anti Zionism, which is factually incorrect, racist, discriminatory, and silences the right of free speech for people advocating for an end to the genocide and killing in Gaza. As our representatives, you have a responsibility to protect our freedom of speech and truly represent the opinions of your constituents, so vote no on the resolution.

[2023-12-05, 2:12:15 PM] ~ Amro: I want to underscore the importance of this - the percentage of voters who support Palestine over Israel is becoming significant, and it's important our reps know that going into the next elections, if not at least to think twice about who they accept donations from. Idk if y'all followed the hearing in Congress this morning, but the level of unhinged Zionist rhetoric and disregard of Palestinians, Arabs, or Muslims by the Congress members reached laughably insane levels, with a constant pressure on our university presidents to straight out doxx and expel pro Palestinian students.

I don’t know why you want to be called by the name you claim everyone calls you by, but I assume it has to do with it being all uppercase letters. Just knowing someone by a pronoun “him” doesn’t seem very respectful. So, I’ll personally call you Abdullah, and I think you should request people pronounce your entire name instead of some other pronoun.

[2023-12-07, 9:59:54 AM] ~ Abdurrahman Arif: Asalamualaikum everyone, after having conversations with folks after Ustadha Yasmin Mogahed’s event, I realize I didn’t emphasize something important in light of our outreach to administration. While President Cabrera has refused to show any public support to us, other administration including Dr.Hong and others have shown much support and attended the memorial and teach-in. In general, administration has expressed a lot of respect for our organization because of how we went about everything. The focus behind President Cabrera’s support is mainly because of his influence to bring awareness about the humanitarian crisis to the entire student body. Nevertheless, it’s great that we do have support from some administration and we hope to utilize those relationships as best as possible.

[2023-12-08, 11:19:24 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Jummah Gem:

Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, one of the greatest scholars of Islam and revivers of the Sunnah, endured great hardship largely due to his immense efforts to guide people back to the right path. His son, Abdullah, asked his father one day: “Abi when will we ever relax?” His father looked him in the eye and said: “With the first step we take into Jannah.”

We may feel tired of speaking up for the injustices in Gaza and elsewhere. We may feel burnt out from the constant guilt of feeling like we aren't doing enough. But, the reality is we really aren't doing enough. The Muhsineen 'The Good-doers' don't take breaks from doing good or else they wouldn't carry that title. This life isn't meant for breaks. That's what Jannah is for.

"And be patient, and your patience is not but through Allah. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire. Indeed, Allah is with those who have taqwa and those who are Muhsinoon." -Qur'an, 16:127-128

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

I wanted to let you know about this cool opportunity if you don’t have plans the week of christmas during break.
My muslim youth organization, Muslim Youth of North America, is hosting their annual south Atlantic regional camp in florida dec 23-30. Right now we’re looking for a couple more girl and guy camp counselors. Honestly it’s such an amazing experience, you get to meet so many people and learn from some brilliant scholars and most importantly play such a key role in youth’s camp experience and their development as a Muslim - you truly make a difference.
If you are interested in applying, you can go to http://myna.org/counselors 
and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions inshAllah
[2023-12-15, 11:28:30 AM] ~ Abrar Hoque: I did it last year and Alhamdullilah it was an amazing experience, they actually bring in a couple of really knowledgeable scholars that allowed me to learn a lot and you get to spend a lot of quality time with them.

[2023-12-22, 4:31:20 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Jummah Gem:

It’s our duty to ALWAYS defend what’s right — not just when it’s trending, not just when it’s convenient, and not just when we see expected outcomes. We tirelessly defend what’s right because that’s who we are. Our values and beliefs cannot waiver or else who are we really? Aren’t those what truly constitute our identity? 

“And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful.” Qur’an, 3:104

As the new year approaches, people often define resolutions, most of which have to do with fitness or financial goals. While this is important, this is also a good time to take a step back and reflect on bigger questions. 

Who would you like to be going forward? 
What is your purpose in this life? 
What is the intention behind the goals and work you do?
What impact do you believe you can have on this world?
How will you change yourself and the world around you for the greater good?

Let's all use this time to answer these questions in light of the greater question Allah asks us in Surah Takwir--

"So where are you going? It is not except a reminder to the worlds for whoever wills among you to take a right course. But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds." (81:26-29)

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

[2023-12-31, 11:01:44 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Hot glue, in small quantities, shouldn’t ruin the thing, but it likely won’t fix the problem. The two wires might need to have a certain bandwidth across it, and the hot glue might just introduce extra resistance.
[2023-12-31, 11:02:13 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: In short, the hot glue might be a temporary solution.

[2024-01-05, 1:19:03 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Jummah Gem:

"The line between the aggressive intensity needed to win games and destructive anger is razor thin. In some Native American tribes, the elders used to identify the angriest braves in the village and teach them to transform their wild, uncontrolled energy into a source of creative power and strength. Those braves often became the most effective tribal leaders.” -Phil Jackson

It's natural to feel anger as we witness corruption and oppression. We may be angry at those causing it, influencers who aren't stepping up, or even at ourselves for not doing more. However, anger is a destructive force that causes more damage than good. We don't have to dismiss it or bottle it up--we just have to transform it into positive, productive energy. In the end, fire doesn't extinguish fire, water does. Hate doesn't extinguish hate, love does.

"Oh you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And be mindful of Allah; indeed, Allah is [fully] Aware of what you do. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds [that] for them there is forgiveness and great reward." -Qur'an, 5:8

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

[2024-01-06, 12:59:23 PM] Umar Manzoor: Miftaah Seminar Tour with Shaykh Yasir Qadhi

✨Where do we find inspiration in our daily lives? Is it from "influencers" online or rather from the one whose teachings have influenced the entire world 🌍? The Prophet (SAW) is the best of examples in every way.

👉Join Miftaah Institute as we host Shaykh Yasir Qadhi for our seminar tour! In this seminar, we will not only go over various stories 📖 of the Prophet (SAW), but we have selected specific stories to help us practically transform our lives.

🗺️ Join us in any of these cities that are near you:
- February 3rd in 📍 Orlando, FL
- February 4th in 📍Atlanta, GA

📖 Learn the seerah in a way that allows us to return home 🏠 with better qualities, and ultimately, help us become better people.

[2024-01-09, 12:52:15 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: It might depend on the major. For example, CS major restrictions for most graduate-level classes dropped yesterday. Waitlists drop on Thursday, which is usually when you’ll be able to sign up for a previously restricted class.

When I took it we wasted most of the semester learning the basics of programming and there was hardly any time left to cover inheritance in depth. I don't think we even talked about Polymorphism. The class was a joke and I only took because it was required for my major

[2024-01-12, 12:35:07 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Jummah Gem:

Witnessing South Africa standing against the injustice faced by the Palestinian people in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is truly an eye-opening, inspiring moment that will be captured in history. Their courage in challenging Israel in the ICJ brings to life the countless stories of the Qur'an about the justice faced by nations that were arrogant and vehemently transgressed. South Africa truly exemplifies what it means to use the injustices and pain one faced in the past as a source of strength rather than fear. Let's follow their example and use what we know and have experienced to fuel us to create a better world.

"And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful ones. And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment." -3:104-105

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

Studies have found that we typically have anywhere from 12,000 to 60,000 thoughts per day. These can be categorized as positive vs. negative or actionable vs. unactionable. Positive actionable thoughts are much more beneficial if acted upon. Unactionable thoughts can also be useful if they increase wisdom or understanding the more we reflect on them. We should be cautious of thoughts that drive negative actions or feelings if we act or dwell on them. As we have thoughts, we should categorize them this way so that we can take advantage of the thousands of thoughts we have everyday.

"Take what is given freely, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant. And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allāh. Indeed, He is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. Indeed, those who are mindful of Allāh - when an impulse touches them from Satan, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight." -Qur'an, 199-201

Have a blessed Jumu'ah!

[2024-01-26, 1:55:43 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Legendary Jummah Gem:

Assalamualaikum, I just wanted to share that after 13 beautiful years, I'll be taking a step back from sending Jumu'ah Gems every week. My deepest intent with these messages has always been for us to turn back to Allah and His words in the Qur'an. I hoped to remind you all that religion and spirituality can and should be an integral part of each moment that encompasses our day. May we all turn sincerely in submission to Our Loving Creator and remember that the greatest of gems are captured perfectly in The Qur'an.

"So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great. Then, I swear by the setting of the stars, and this, if you only knew, is indeed a great oath. Surely, it is a noble Qur'an in a register well-protected. None touch it except the purified. A revelation from the Lord of the worlds. Then, is it to this statement that you are indifferent and your denial that you take as your livelihood?" -Surah Waqi'ah, 74-82.

Have a blessed Jumu'ah! Thank you for allowing me to share these reminders with you over the years 🤍

[2024-02-13, 1:07:40 PM] Sualeh: Ngl the dinner was very disappointing. Why did the MSA involve dancing? It's terrible to say it's an event for the sake of our brothers and sisters suffering in Palestine, yet we openly sin in that gathering, if anything worsening the state the ummah is in.
[2024-02-13, 1:08:12 PM] Sualeh: But to answer the question lol, just check the organizations the funds were going too and donate directly to them.
[2024-02-13, 1:11:51 PM] Rameez: Have u donated 40k to Palestine? Im just wondering
[2024-02-13, 1:13:53 PM] Sualeh: What benefit would that bring me if I'm dancing for them? Donations don't help the state of the ummah to the extent that our actions do.
[2024-02-13, 1:14:36 PM] Sualeh: I'm by no means saying a 40k donation is a small thing, I'm making the point that what was done was wrong
[2024-02-13, 1:16:54 PM] Rameez: Throw ur own event for Palestine and have it organized exactly how u want it. At the end of the day it wasnt just the MSA organising it. There were many other external bodies involved so it is disingenuous to criticise just the MSA
[2024-02-13, 1:19:56 PM] Sualeh: Idk why saying dancing is a sin angers you so much but alright. I do what's within my capabilities and the MSA does what's within their's, perhaps it wasn't the fault of the MSA, and you could just say it like that if that's the case. Say something to counter the point aside from trying to insult me.

[2024-02-13, 1:23:55 PM] Usayd: Salam everyone, we have a board meeting today which will be open for anyone to join at 6pm. Itll be in Techwood right across the reflection room.

[2024-02-13, 1:31:10 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: @17708654795 dancing is a sin and it’s fine to take issue with it but this feels less of a genuine reminder and more of an attack. consistently announcing your disdain to a group chat of 400 when you personally know the organizers of all the events doesn’t inspire anyone
[2024-02-13, 1:31:56 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: the best form of dawah is gentle and through character
[2024-02-13, 1:33:38 PM] ~ Abdurrahman Arif: Bruh
[2024-02-13, 1:33:43 PM] ~ Abdurrahman Arif: I almost kicked u cuz of that pfp
[2024-02-13, 1:35:26 PM] Sualeh: I apologize if it seemed like an attack, it was not intended to be that way. It was also not dawah to the extent of what I know, simply because I was voicing my concerns over an issue I saw. I in no way have ill feelings towards the MSA, and I think it does great things beyond the scope of what very few organizations do. My intent was to call out a sin, as what has been advised by the prophet. Again, I did not intend to attack anyone, but only to call something out. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-13, 3:09:15 PM] Sualeh: Renegotiating after signing on an amount is quite difficult from my experience
[2024-02-13, 3:09:36 PM] Sualeh: If it's a negotiation before signing, that's only normal
[2024-02-13, 3:09:52 PM] Sualeh: From my experience though, different people may have different experiences

[2024-02-14, 7:02:50 AM] ~ Abdurrahman Arif: Asalamualaikum, 

Our board would like to address some of the concerns and feedback brought up regarding the fundraising dinner. We weren’t made aware beforehand that the dabke group would ask the audience to stand up and join them; hence, we did not foresee men and women both joining the dabke which we didn’t intend. We hope to learn from this and do better in the future inshaAllah. Please forgive us for any mistakes we’ve made and overlook any faults in the event. It took us hundreds of hours to plan the dinner and alhamdulilah we successfully raised more than $23,000 for Gaza so we would appreciate if everyone remains focused on the positive impact we made and the most pressing issues that require our attention as an Ummah.

[2024-02-28, 7:57:47 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: And how do you stop someone from tagging you out?
[2024-02-28, 7:58:57 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Also, how do you tag someone out discreetly if it’s not a game setup where you’re forced to close your eyes?
[2024-02-28, 8:35:23 AM] Usayd: Run
[2024-02-28, 8:44:33 AM] Tahir: you find them and chase them down with either a nerf gun or a water gun
[2024-02-28, 8:44:46 AM] Tahir: there's certain safe zones
[2024-02-28, 8:59:05 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Alright, say no more.
[2024-02-28, 10:10:03 AM] Tawhid Ahmed: nerf gun for sure, more accuracy is needed
[2024-02-28, 10:11:26 AM] Tawhid Ahmed: one shot only or no?
[2024-02-28, 10:16:38 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: No way people are actually considering running inside buildings on campus with nerf guns for a week. There’s got to be a much better way to organize this or just abandon the idea.
[2024-02-28, 10:17:31 AM] Tahir: it's much more nuanced than that, we have a ruleset that we'll release
[2024-02-28, 10:17:46 AM] Tahir: at the moment we just want to know if folks are interested
[2024-02-28, 10:19:10 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: I still don’t get the “tagging” part yet. If someone tries to tag you, but that person isn’t the one you’re assigned to tag, then do you just have to run away from that person for an entire week? At this rate, everyone’s just going to avoid being near anyone else in the MSA for a week.
Yes, a more nuanced ruleset would be greatly appreciated.
[2024-02-28, 10:20:52 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: I think it’s a matter of only having to avoid one person at a time, based on things I’ve seen in the past but again i am not sure how msa’s rules are gonna be

[2024-02-29, 7:51:24 AM] Hassan Moe Guy Food: There also like safe zones so like the student center or at least the 3 floor would be safe so u cant tag someone there. The whole point of the game is less about tagging them and more about "being an assassin". People will like try to tag u after class or find out where u parked and hide out there

[2024-02-29, 11:44:27 PM] Muadh: @13135550002 how do you play assassin with waterguns?
[2024-02-29, 11:44:31 PM] Meta AI: Playing Assassin with water guns is a fun and refreshing twist on the classic game! Here's how you can play:

1. Gather a group of players and assign each player a target to "assassinate" using a water gun.
2. Players must sneak up on their target and shoot them with a water gun to "kill" them.
3. If a player is hit, they're out of the game.
4. The last player remaining wins.
5. To add an extra level of challenge, you can set boundaries or obstacles to navigate, like a designated "safe zone" where players can't be attacked.
6. Make sure to play fairly and safely, and have fun!

Remember to play in a safe and controlled environment, and always prioritize safety and respect for others. Sounds like a splashing good time! ‎<This message was edited>

If person A has person B as his current target, but person B has some person C as his target, then when person A tries to assassinate person B, what can person B do in that moment to prevent getting assassinated since person A isn’t his target?

[2024-03-12, 1:52:13 PM] ~ Abrar Hoque: ^the importance of this is to showcase how much of an impact/sway the Muslim population has on the outcome. This will cause candidates to recognize us and try to appease to our demands. Leaving it blank communicates our discontentment with the current administration policies/rhetoric, and how that Muslims are no longer guaranteed to vote for democrat. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-14, 11:17:12 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: The gold line is the only rail line running to the airport after 9 PM.
[2024-03-14, 11:19:45 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: So brother @14753230757, if you’re coming from Buckhead or any station north of it on the red line, you’ll have to transfer at the Lindbergh Center station to a southbound gold line train, if the destination of the train you’re on is Lindbergh Center. If it’s Airport, then you can proceed straight to the Airport station.
[2024-03-14, 11:20:05 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: https://www.itsmarta.com/Red-Line.aspx
[2024-03-14, 11:20:18 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Here’s the schedule for the red line for your reference.
[2024-03-14, 11:26:35 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: @14753230757, Google Maps and the MARTA On the Go app are other resources you can use to plan your trip to the airport.
[2024-03-14, 11:39:14 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Keep in mind tho: the arrival times shown on either app may or may not be up to date. Take it from me.
[2024-03-14, 11:42:38 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Btw, if any of you guys hop on the blue line, there are delays pretty much every weekday (Idk abt weekends) cuz of construction going on at the Indian Creek station. Even tho Google Maps may say a blue line train is delayed, there’s a slight chance that by the time you’re already at a MARTA station, there will already be a train arriving, most likely cuz this one was delayed as well. So plan your trips accordingly if you need to hop on the blue line.

[2024-03-31, 10:55:21 PM] Junaid: Salamu Alaykum everyone, these last 10 nights are very important to the point where it can change the lives of someone forever. Discuss with your fellow family and friends and the duuas you guys can make for each other. Do NOT hesitate to ask for literally anything no matter how big or how small or how silly or how serious. It can be so powerful that it could guide people to Islam, the most unexpected people towards Islam. I know this because someone definitely prayed for me to become a Muslim, now look at how everything change now Alhamdulilah.. Alhamdulilah all around, I am praying every single night for you guys because I genuinely love you guys from the bottom of my heart. Wallahi you guys are my first real Islamic community where I feel belonged in. Lets make these last 10 days as if its our last Ramadan in this dunya together. I love you guy Jazhakallah Khairen.

If I ever wronged you, please know that I am sorry and regardless of what ever happened, I love you all as my brothers and Allah truly bestowed great favors upon me when letting me come to the US ❤️

My name is Usman Rafique and I was admitted to the Aerospace Engineering major at Georgia Tech.

I’m doing a study abroad program this summer and have started this GoFundMe page to raise some money towards my costs and expenses. Unfortunately, my financial aid will only cover a portion and I will have to cover the rest out of pocket. In the spirit of this blessed month of Ramadan and the reward of giving, I would appreciate any contribution you might be able to make, no matter how small I am beyond grateful. If you could also share this link with your families, friends, and colleagues, it would be very much appreciated. May Allah reward you for anything you can help me out with. Jazak Allah Khairan and may Allah accept 🤲🏽

[2024-04-09, 6:06:54 AM] Muadh: Bidding Farewell to Ramadan:

"How can the believer not shed tears at the departure of Ramadan, when he does not know if he will live to the next Ramadan?" - (Ibn Rajab (rahimahullāh))

Our hearts feel sad. Our cheeks are damp with tears. As we bid farewell to our beloved friend (i.e. Ramadan), we reflect on the shortness of its visit. Is this a metaphor for life? Will it pass by like the blink of an eye?

I should have done more. I shouldn't have wasted my time. These are regrets we are all familiar with. However, we still have precious hours remaining. Let us make the most of them. The Prophet said, "Indeed, deeds are only judged by their endings" (Bukhārī).

Ibn al-Jawzī (rahimahullāh) writes, "When the race horse knows that it is nearing the end of the track, it exerts all of its effort to win the race. Do not allow the race horse to be cleverer than you. Indeed, deeds are judged by their conclusions. Thus, if you didn't do well with welcoming Ramadan then perhaps you will do better bidding it farewell."

Ibn Rajab (rahimahullāh) reminds us, "O Servants of Allah! Ramadan is ending, and very little of it remains: whoever from you spent it well should finish it the same way; and whoever is falling behind should finish it in the best manner, for the reward of actions are determined by their ending."

Let us not waste these last precious moments doing Eid preparations. Let us not become complacent about attending the tarāwīh prayers, just because the imām has finished the recitation (khatm) of the Qur'an.

"What matters the most are excellent endings, not faulty beginnings." - Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh)

As we come to the end of this great month, let us end it keeping the following five pointers in mind:

1) Fear your actions not being accepted 

2) Ask Allah to accept your good deeds

3) Thank Allah and seek forgiveness 

4) Be wary of pride and Ujb (feeling pleased with one's own accomplishments)

5) Give sadaqat al-fitr

As we end this blessed month, let us make a firm intention of continuing to worship Allah and staying away from sin, starting off with the blessed night of Eid. Let us recite the takbīrāt in abundance and let us continue with the habit of qiyām al-layl, even if it is just two rak'ahs.

May Allah al-Shakūr (The Most Appreciative) accept our worship, forgive our sins and make us from His chosen servants.

'Abdullah b. Mas'ud (radiy Allāhu 'anhu) would say in the last night of Ramadan, "Who amongst us has been accepted, so that we might congratulate them? And who among us has been deprived of acceptance, so that we might console them?"

[2024-04-09, 2:55:23 PM] Junaid: Everyone, Salamu Alaikum Eid Mubarak I hope everyone is doing well. I just hit my 1 year mark as a Muslim.
Last year around this time in the last fasting day of Ramadan, an Hour after Dhuhr prayer I took my shahada at Masjid Al Farooq.

I want to say I love everyone who has been part of this journey and I want to send my appreciations and thanks to every single one of you guys.
Every single one of you guys played a very important and significant role in my life because without you guys It would be hard for me to be steadfast as a single revert.
Alhamdulilah all around I’ve never felt this content in my life. Every time I see one of you guys yall make me smile happily with so much noor in my face. Wallahi I wouldn’t be able to stand school or the trials of life without you guys. I really appreciate how genuine and real you guys are and seeing how you guys grow together as not just Muslims but real human beings with life and purpose. It makes me tear up quite a bit ngl. The best part is that many of you guys I don’t see every single day but I’ve had a few amazing conversation with you guys and really get to see how genuine and real you guy are. It makes me happy knowing that I could simply connect with you guys because we say La Ilaha Illallah. 

I want to share this one thing I’ve learned from this entire trip so far being a Muslim.

Allah will bring you from and to places you would never imagine.

Wallahi one month before I converted I barely knew anything about Islam and I was far far far from the deen. 

Some in a single month Allah granted me his boundless Mercy and I took my shahada and found the real guidance of life.

I don’t know what else to say other than I really pray that Allah forgives every single one of you guys and grant you guys Jannah Al Firdous. 

Alhamdulilah, Thank you guys for everything. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-04-09, 9:11:17 PM] ‪+1 (404) 203‑1579‬: Zakat ul fitr or sadaqat-ul-fitr is 1 sa'aa (approx 2.5kg) of food supplies (rice, wheat, etc) given to the needy before the Eid Salah. It is usually paid by the head of the household on behalf of everyone. I believe it is mandatory for everyone.
[2024-04-09, 9:11:48 PM] Junaid: where can i pay it?
[2024-04-09, 9:12:02 PM] Tahir: boxes at back of farooq
[2024-04-09, 9:12:05 PM] ‪+1 (404) 203‑1579‬: Al Farooq masjid is collecting $10 (I believe to buy these supplies) and distribute them among the needy
[2024-04-09, 9:12:54 PM] ‪+1 (404) 203‑1579‬: You can pay it online as well but I think they prefer cash
[2024-04-09, 9:13:03 PM] Aboubacar: If I’m not mistaken, it is better for you to do it in your own (give the food to a needy Muslim person on your own) 

But if you do not know anyone, then yes… I think it is okay to partner with the masjids and have them do it for you.
[2024-04-09, 9:14:26 PM] ‪+1 (404) 203‑1579‬: Yes, absolutely. It's only for the sake of everyone's convenience. Allah knows best
[2024-04-09, 9:14:52 PM] ‪+1 (404) 203‑1579‬: But make sure to pay it before Eid Salah
[2024-04-09, 9:16:52 PM] Aboubacar: Yes. Allah the almighty knows best. 

Yes, please give it before Eid Salah. Otherwise it will be considered sadaqah

It would be good to minimize this for multiple reasons. The sunnah of wudu is to minimize water usage, and one is supposed to prevent water getting on their clothes to the best of their ability. inshaAllah let us try to splash less water when we make wudu to better follow this sunnah, avoid wasting water, and better respect the time of the people who have to clean up after us

It plagued people during the time of the prophet Muhammad (pbuh), and it still plagues people 1400 years later. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-04-12, 7:50:56 PM] Junaid: Bro the Prophet Muhammad when he was revealed the Quran, it was confirmation for the text that came before which was the Gospel and the Torah. Literally the Quran literally proved the previous revelations
[2024-04-12, 7:51:08 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Yeah but they don’t like to hear that
[2024-04-12, 7:51:17 PM] Junaid: That simple statement I just said should be the very reason they should convert to Islam
[2024-04-12, 7:51:33 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: All they take from that is “oh the Quran said the word of God cant be changed so how did the bible get corrupt like you all say??”
[2024-04-12, 7:51:57 PM] Junaid: Because no man in the middle of a Desert would come to confirm the textures of the Gospel or the Torah which having access to information back then was like zero to non because nobody had phones back then.
[2024-04-12, 7:52:35 PM] Junaid: Literally the biggest problem is that they follow Jesus (AS) but they don't even know how to live like him because he was raised to the Heavens before the Romans could crucify him
[2024-04-12, 7:52:44 PM] Junaid: absolutely funny

[2024-04-12, 7:56:40 PM] ~ Abdurrahmane Rikli: Which is hard because they enjoy being cynical
[2024-04-12, 7:57:43 PM] Junaid: One of the sunnahs I believe is that if you do NOT know anything, say "I dont know"
[2024-04-12, 7:58:38 PM] Junaid: They enjoy being cynical until Allah test them with losses, the most profound insight and experience I've gone through is seeing how atheist handle hardships (within my own family)

[2024-04-16, 5:04:47 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Salam brothers one thing to note: ‼️
Make sure to vote for people that actually show up to SC and involve themselves with the MSA community beyond events at a personal level. Not people that only show up once in a while when they feel like it. But people that if you go to SC you actually expect to see them there. These board members are supposed to be leaders of the MSA. You can’t lead an organisation unless you’re really part of it. Like Tahir Rameez Mirza Hamzah etc are always there. Everyone knows them. So make sure to consider this before voting

[2024-04-17, 1:00:37 AM] Rameez: No i was meaning itll be really dark at that point and coordinating the massive maghrib salat is going to throw everything out of place

[2024-04-17, 7:19:51 AM] Sualeh: It was not well organized and that was stated by the organizers. Nonetheless, suhoor fests are usually very mixed events in general. I don't believe this event will be an issue of nearly that magnitude, provided atleast us and the GT sisters get there first and set a good example as to what sort of event it is and how we should act. If we can set the right mood in the beginning it should be fine inshallah

[2024-04-22, 9:33:32 PM] Rameez: in my opinion the best west campus dorm is freeman

[2024-04-22, 9:34:03 PM] Rameez: it was a lot of haram activity
[2024-04-22, 9:34:05 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: glenn and towers are genuinely regarded as best
[2024-04-22, 9:34:29 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: however it’s on east which is very social so can get noisy sometimes but not too bad
[2024-04-22, 9:34:41 PM] Rameez: freeman also has the biggest dorm size on campus
[2024-04-22, 9:34:55 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: just don’t get smith or brown and ur fine
[2024-04-22, 9:35:14 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: west is a lot more chill and quieter
[2024-04-22, 9:35:17 PM] ~ Hadi Syed: I agree with this
[2024-04-22, 9:35:31 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: and closer to CRC which imo is good advantage

[2024-04-22, 9:36:29 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: west is best, also spend the extra couple hundred for the apartment style (u get ur own room), 100% worth it
[2024-04-22, 9:36:54 PM] ~ Usman: Thanks for convincing me!
[2024-04-22, 9:37:18 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: also another thing, there are certain dorms that are LLC only meaning u gotta join a group to be in them (Matheson, Perry, Cloudman, Etc) but sometimes they open up to everyone toward the end
[2024-04-22, 9:37:39 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: I was originally going to be in Smith then Matheson opened up for everyone and I ended up living there and it was fine
[2024-04-22, 9:38:11 PM] Aboubacar: Wa alaikum Salaam. Welcome to Tech my brother. Worry not. The GT MSA Will always be here for you in sha Allah. 

When it comes to dorms, I would say it depends on your personal preference. I stayed on West campus for my 1st 3 years. 
-
I love West campus because it is more quiet, more chill, closer to the Campus Rec center… and a lot of the engineering classes/buildings are closer to west I think. 
-
I lived in Freeman (shared dorm) my first year, Woodruff South (suite) my 2nd year, and Maulding (apartment) my 3rd year 

East campus is closer to the frats, basketball stadium, football stadium, baseball stadium… the city… basically all the noise (but it is also closer to more off-campus food options)
[2024-04-22, 9:38:16 PM] ~ Usman: For apartment stay do I have to choose a roommate or do they assign?
[2024-04-22, 9:38:49 PM] Aboubacar: I currently live on Tech square (closer to east campus) but this is my last year. 

Plus, I’m a business major so living on this side of town is closer to my classes.
[2024-04-22, 9:38:50 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: You can choose still I believe or go random up to you
[2024-04-22, 9:38:57 PM] Aboubacar: ^ hope this helps.
[2024-04-22, 9:39:24 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: GT has a roommate matching thing on their housing portal though so try and find someone on there and talk to people randoms is a bit risky
[2024-04-22, 9:40:34 PM] ~ Usman: Thank you so much for all the information! Allhamdullilah GT MSA seems very active compared to other schools. That was one of the reasons I chose GT. By any chance do any of you know anyone coming from Los Angeles to GT this upcoming year?
[2024-04-22, 9:41:42 PM] Rameez: No
[2024-04-22, 9:41:54 PM] Rameez: There are some Instagram pages like GT class of 2028 or something

The event is 4-6pm at McCamish and you don’t need any tickets. But you’ll need to check in your backpacks across the street.

Alhamdulilah, through this community I have been able to embrace my identity as a Muslim without feeling out of place. Spending Ramadan with you all was such a blessing and strengthened my imaan in ways I did not expect. And the love we all have for each other is unbreakable, which I appreciate so so so much. Know that you all have a brother in me and I will always look out for each and every one of you all. 🤞🏽

[2024-05-22, 2:52:11 PM] Junaid: @17705454205 You were applying to a bunch of places at Tech and ur BIOMED Engineer so you might be able to help @14702321277
[2024-05-22, 2:59:23 PM] ~ Abdurrahman Arif: I haven’t worked with a neuro lab, @14704297310 is a neuro major he might be able to help with that
[2024-05-22, 3:00:10 PM] ~ Abdurrahman Arif: In general though unless you know a professor you’ll probably just have to go with cold emailing
[2024-05-22, 3:00:58 PM] ~ 🇵🇸: thanks for the connect, however if you’re interested in a psychology lab as well you can dm @16784880988 he was a psych major

[2024-05-22, 9:29:47 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Nah. Haven’t been there in years.
[2024-05-22, 9:31:57 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Btw, did you guys hear that Red Lobster’s filing for bankruptcy?
[2024-05-22, 9:32:52 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: That’s a major letdown. Their cheddar bay biscuits slapped. Idk if all locations in Georgia are affected tho. So far I think it’s just the Roswell location.
[2024-05-22, 9:32:57 PM] ‪+1 (470) 232‑1277‬: Noooooo my cheddar bay biscuits 😭
[2024-05-22, 9:33:16 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Better buy em in the store then
[2024-05-22, 9:33:42 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: That’s the way we gotta go if all locations in Georgia end up closing
[2024-05-22, 9:35:00 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Also, if any of you guys have worked / volunteered at a hospital, what was it like? I am trying to make better use of my time while I’m searching for a job and figured volunteering at the hospital would be better than being a deadbeat bum at home.
[2024-05-22, 9:36:07 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: I was singlehandedly keeping them in business but I got busy mb
[2024-05-22, 9:36:32 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: We need them to stay in business bro
[2024-05-22, 9:36:45 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: facts i gotta keep goin
[2024-05-22, 9:36:53 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: luckily they’re not closing all locations
[2024-05-22, 9:36:57 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: but they’re closing a lot
[2024-05-22, 9:38:12 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I haven’t been to Red Lobster in years, but it’ll still be a disappointment if I can’t get my cheddar bay biscuits fresh out of the oven there.
[2024-05-22, 9:38:26 PM] Rameez: What field are you trying to get into? Volunteering/shadowing/working are all good ways to get hospital experience. Scribing is an example of a hospital job many people do which is documenting the work of a doctor through their day. You have medical assisting and then you also have shadowing as well. These are all cool fields to tap into. Im personally a bigger fan of EMT work rather then any of these but the training costs money, however u get paid after it and it pays the best of these entry medical positions
[2024-05-22, 9:39:23 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I’m actually a CS major. I’m planning on getting an internship at a later time, but in the meantime, I’m looking for entry-level jobs that don’t require much skills and whatnot.
[2024-05-22, 9:39:51 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: And I keep on hitting dead ends tryna search for a job, so volunteering will be like a temporary fix until I find one.
[2024-05-22, 9:40:24 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I got laid off this past Monday from my cashier job, but I blame the owner for not reaching out to me directly to resolve the issues they had with me.
[2024-05-22, 9:40:47 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: At least my manager tried to convince them to let me stay tho. She was a real one for that.
[2024-05-22, 9:41:28 PM] Rameez: Got you. Sorry bout that bro. Theres plenty of medical places hiring, but be warned you will get paid nothing or minimum wage
[2024-05-22, 9:42:47 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: What year are you? If you’re heading into your junior year, I would actually recommend working on a personal project. You’ll get some more real-world experience and InshaAllah it’ll help you get an internship later.
[2024-05-22, 9:43:18 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I’ll be a junior in the fall. And ya, I was actually thinking about doing a project, but I haven’t gotten to doing it yet.
[2024-05-22, 9:43:40 PM] ‪+1 (470) 232‑1277‬: Volunteer at Shepherd Center, you can help stroke victims learn how to walk and talk again and stuff. Its like a neuro rehab center. Close to SCAD.
[2024-05-22, 9:44:15 PM] ‪+1 (470) 232‑1277‬: Theyre also hiring i can give you a referral, my buddy who is a real estate mogul works there for fun, its fulfilling work.
[2024-05-22, 9:44:38 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Too far from my house, even if MARTA and Ride Gwinnett work in my favor. Thx tho. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-22, 9:45:57 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Thx man. I’ll keep that in mind. The closet hospital to my house is Piedmont Eastside Medical Center. I was looking on their website to see what open positions they had, but the ones that I saw were more geared towards those in the medical field, as expected. So I thought volunteering might be the next best thing in the mean time. I went to the main campus hospital yesterday, talked to a couple people throughout the hospital, and ended up picking up a volunteer application form should I choose to volunteer there.
[2024-05-22, 9:46:29 PM] Rameez: Good luck bro the comeback gonna be insane

[2024-05-23, 1:12:09 PM] Sualeh: Imagine coping this hard
[2024-05-23, 1:14:01 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I only tried their fries and iced coffee. I don’t think any of their meat is halal. Ever since I heard the fries and hash browns at McDonald’s have beef flavor as an ingredient, I stopped eating them. I found other alternatives to them, including Whataburger fries as they don’t have any haram ingredients.

[2024-05-23, 1:43:38 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I tried the actual boba when I first went there, but it wrecked my stomach. So I stick with the regular milk tea with the coffee popping bubbles. That’s like the best drink to get imo. I tried other spots as well, but the only other one I really like is Mochinut.

[2024-05-23, 2:20:31 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: I barely managed to pass Chem I, so I’ll need double, actually triple, Einstein’s IQ to pass these classes.
[2024-05-23, 2:20:41 PM] Sualeh: Thermo and fluids is the only hard classes

[2024-05-23, 2:21:25 PM] Sualeh: Oh wait mb I thought y'all meant the circuit class
[2024-05-23, 2:21:26 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: and decently hard

[2024-05-23, 2:22:16 PM] Sualeh: Oh yeah that one is a bit difficult
[2024-05-23, 2:22:16 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Statics = not moving
Dynamics = moving
[2024-05-23, 2:22:20 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: ^
[2024-05-23, 2:22:24 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Hope that helps 👍🏼
[2024-05-23, 2:22:27 PM] Sualeh: Makes sense

[2024-05-23, 2:33:50 PM] Tahir: Assalamualaikum everyone,

 Just wanted to share a couple of house keeping rules and expectations. This is a public group chat and we would like everybody to maintain a level of adab and decency as to respect our Islamic values. 

The following will not be tolerated:
- Racism of any kind regardless of whether it's a joke or not
- Misogynist comments disrespecting women
- explicit and vulgar language
- Glorifying acts of violence
- Supporting terrorists as identified by the US state department 

Jazakallahkhair
[2024-05-23, 2:51:11 PM] Junaid: Bro shoulda said that when the entire chat was cooking me 💀 subhan Allah tho
[2024-05-23, 2:51:56 PM] ~ Omar Jaafar: Bruh who was doing that LEAVE JUNAID ALONE.
[2024-05-23, 2:52:27 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Talk to em omar 🗣️
[2024-05-23, 2:54:15 PM] Junaid: Omar you talking when u is the main one 💀

[2024-05-23, 3:01:54 PM] Tawfiq: The resistance in Gaza and Palestinian resistance in general are considered terrorist groups by the US state department.
[2024-05-23, 3:03:06 PM] ~ Momen: Also, Nelson Mandela pre 2008 was on that list too, so I guess supporting him in 2007 wouldn't have been tolerated either
[2024-05-23, 3:03:43 PM] ‪+1 (404) 203‑9765‬: Assalamualikum. Anyone on campus for summer who would be willing to pick up mail for me from the post office?
[2024-05-23, 3:34:12 PM] ~ usama: This is a public and non-vetted group so I think what the rules broadly mean is that we must be careful with our words while talking about organizations identified as terrorists by the US state department. One’s personal views can be different but the rule just concerns with posts and conversations in this group.
[2024-05-23, 3:35:52 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Ahh hn
[2024-05-23, 4:00:09 PM] Sualeh: This^
[2024-05-23, 4:01:08 PM] Sualeh: The main point of this message is that this chat is a representation of the MSA, so it's ideal that we be careful with our words in regards to the mentioned cases
[2024-05-23, 4:02:03 PM] Nabeel: Wait what'd I miss
[2024-05-23, 4:02:15 PM] Nabeel: I'm sorry for calling ECEs fake 😭
[2024-05-23, 4:34:24 PM] ~ usama: Sorry to drag this on but it’s important to mention that the matter is slightly more nuanced. The MSA and the community do not have to agree with every definition given by the U.S. state department. In fact, there are so many legit political and non-political organizations that do not agree with so many of those definitions. However, when it comes to voicing your opinions in public or how your opinions transform into actions, you must be careful with your choice of words and abide by the law in order to avoid any legal repercussions or criminal charges.
[2024-05-23, 4:39:05 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: what’s the best boba in atl? everything i’ve had is 🐕 💦

[2024-05-23, 4:39:59 PM] ~ Momen: I agree with the sentiment of the message, but I disagree with the authority being prescribed to the state department. The U.S. state department isn't an exception to the first amendment of the constitution. Don't allow the government to reign more power over you than they truly wield.

[2024-05-23, 4:48:17 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: The only reason Kung Fu Tea’s at the top of my list is cuz it’s the only spot that has coffee-flavored popping bubbles. That’s all.

[2024-05-24, 12:50:26 PM] ~ usama: I respect the sentiment but please try to avoid comments that cause further confusion. The official stance of the US state department is a sovereign Palestinian state but within the framework of a two-state solution and peaceful means of it’s implementation. Any publicly expressed opinion or suggested action within this framework is fine. One does not have to agree with it because it’s not the best solution according to some analyses. And we also know there has been a lot hypocrisy, double standards and lies by US politicians even regarding this official stance and we should certainly be vocal about it. Hopefully inshAllah things will change for the better soon and we can have more freedom to express our opinions regarding how Palestinian freedom should be implemented. We’re already seeing the tide turning in terms of public opinion Alhamdulillah.

[2024-05-29, 10:03:27 PM] Sualeh: So I got a bunch of and gates
[2024-05-29, 10:03:54 PM] Sualeh: But the teacher is dumb so he made the instructions say I can only use NAND gates

[2024-05-29, 10:15:49 PM] Saad Mufti: This is practically relevant because there may be a situation where a manufacturer can make nands much cheaper than other gates so it may be cheaper to use only nands
[2024-05-29, 10:17:04 PM] Saad Mufti: A nand A = ~A
[2024-05-29, 10:18:33 PM] Saad Mufti: A NAND B followed by another nand is the same as an AND

Anyone interested please DM me I’m a bit anxious because imagine trying to explain fajr to a non Muslim 😭.

The suite is two adjacent rooms with two people each, but they share a bathroom, and we wanted to share it with brothers. We are both OOS.
[2024-06-11, 9:22:53 PM] ~ Farzaan Siddiqui: Yea, the drive was about 45-50 min if I left at 7:20

[2024-06-11, 11:08:51 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Bro, 2031 isn’t time consuming as long as you finish the lab before the lab and just go to lab to get check offs. CompE’s are lucky you don’t have to take ECE 2026, right @17708654795? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-06-11, 11:14:09 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Finishing the lab before lab still takes time 😭

[2024-06-12, 8:06:37 AM] ~ Momen: 2026 was just math. There was a handful of fundamental formulas you needed to know and everything was then easily derived from first principles

[2024-06-14, 11:41:21 PM] ~ Usman Rashid: *9 things you should know about the  9th of Dhul Hijjah:*

*1.* It is called the day of Arafah. (Muslim)

*2.* Fasting this day expiates the minor sins of the past and coming year. (Muslim)

*3.* The Prophet peace be upon him said, “Hajj is Arafah” (Ahmad) i.e. Hajj is invalid if one does not go to Arafah during the prescribed timing.

*4.* The monumental Prophetic Last Sermon was delivered on this day.

*5.* Supplication on this day is considered the most virtuous. (Malik; Al-Muwatta)

*6.* The most meritorious remembrance this day is: {there is no God except Allah.

He is One and He has no partner; sovereignty and praise belong to him, and He is powerful over everything}. (Tirmidhi) لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له ، له الملك ، وله الحمد ، وهو على كل شيء قدير

*7.* With the exception of the battle of Badr, Satan is the most disgraced and humiliated on this day. (Al-Muwatta)

*8.* There is no other day on which people are emancipated from the Fire more than this day. (Mustadrak)

*9.* Allah revealed the verse of the Deen being complete on this day.

*—Shaykh Fayaz Tilly*

[2024-06-16, 9:44:26 PM] Saad Mufti: Are you a first year undergrad? If yes it's a little far away but it wouldn't hurt to ask, the primary form of merit aid for bsms other than saving a year of tuition is the GRA(research assistant)/GTA (teaching assistant), which if you get will reduce your costs for the semester to <1k of mandatory fees

[2024-06-16, 10:16:42 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Look up gatech ASEs or advanced standing exams
[2024-06-16, 10:17:09 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: The math department site should have all of theirs. And I believe it’s also offered for CS 1301 and 1331

Good way to network with people in academia
[2024-06-16, 10:31:57 PM] Nabeel: If you're not looking for pay, a lot of groups just let you join if you ask

[2024-06-17, 12:38:10 PM] Tahir: In that case ur ideal fall semester u should take 2020, 2040, and 2026

[2024-06-17, 5:27:14 PM] ~ Sunan: Jizakallah khair, but however the classes I’m taking right now are prerequisites to the classes I want to take in the fall, how will I be able to register for the classes I want if I haven’t been able to send my transcript in yet
[2024-06-17, 5:27:58 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: They can probably give u an exemption for the prerequisites
[2024-06-17, 5:28:15 PM] Nabeel: If you're in College of Computing, I highly recommend you test drive different advisors and not expect much from any one of them

[2024-06-17, 5:28:39 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Worst case scenario you’ll have to wait for Phase 1 registration
[2024-06-17, 5:28:40 PM] Nabeel: College of Computing spends all their budget on research scientists that can bring the big grants and their staff is basically incompetent
[2024-06-17, 5:28:50 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: or phase 2 i mean
[2024-06-17, 5:28:51 PM] Nabeel: I worked there so I know some these people a bit better than usual

[2024-06-17, 5:29:52 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: nah fr @14043418497 and my other P2P mentors clutched
[2024-06-17, 5:30:02 PM] ~ Sunan: Yes but by then the seats will prolly be gone
[2024-06-17, 5:30:08 PM] Nabeel: Study the petition process and know that if an advisor says they can't do something, it usually means they don't want to do the paperwork for it
[2024-06-17, 5:31:35 PM] Nabeel: Navigating administrative BS is an essential career skill IMO, so don't be discouraged by this. It's for your own development and Allah always has the final say

[2024-06-17, 5:32:41 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Most of them are pretty nice. Idk abt bio but u should be fine
[2024-06-17, 5:33:01 PM] ~ Sunan: I’m trying to take the MCAT summer and so I need to get Ochem 2 done fall and biochem done spring so hopefully they’ll understand (i don’t think most advisors do)
[2024-06-17, 5:33:15 PM] ~ Sunan: GSU advisors were smth else
[2024-06-17, 5:33:27 PM] Rameez: whats your major?

[2024-06-17, 5:34:05 PM] Rameez: You can take CHEM 3511 after CHEM 2311
[2024-06-17, 5:34:08 PM] Rameez: Chem 2311 is orgo 1
[2024-06-17, 5:34:14 PM] Rameez: You just need the permit
[2024-06-17, 5:34:25 PM] Rameez: Orgo 2 is borderline useless for the MCAT
[2024-06-17, 5:34:30 PM] ~ Sunan: Where do I get the permit from
[2024-06-17, 5:34:35 PM] Rameez: Email chem department
[2024-06-17, 5:34:58 PM] ~ Sunan: Idk people told me it was useful not as much as biochem tho
[2024-06-17, 5:35:28 PM] Rameez: I took it in march, the only orgo 2 content is identification of very few reaction conditions along with idetnifying oxidation/reductive states
[2024-06-17, 5:35:33 PM] Rameez: that is covered in chem 2
[2024-06-17, 5:35:33 PM] ~ Sunan: I’m a new transfer so I’ll email but idk if they can do anything about it cuz I can’t even open my portal to register for classes
[2024-06-17, 5:35:43 PM] ~ 🇵🇸: dm me i used an override permit
[2024-06-17, 5:36:12 PM] Rameez: you also need to just identify a few specifities on certain types of carbonyls
[2024-06-17, 5:36:15 PM] Rameez: Besides that, nothing
[2024-06-17, 5:36:25 PM] Rameez: you can learn the MCAT orgo 2 knowledge in like 1 day

[2024-06-17, 5:41:34 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: @14704694205 or you’ll have to wait for Phase 2 registration. GaTech typically adds sections for popular classes during phase 2, and freshman often end up being able to take the classes.
[2024-06-17, 5:41:40 PM] Rameez: he mentored @17705454205 on his medical school applicatin as well

[2024-06-17, 5:44:00 PM] Rameez: Orgo 2 and biochem 1 will be hard to get seats for just letting you know
[2024-06-17, 5:44:11 PM] Rameez: The chem department has already said they will not be adding new seats to biochem 2
[2024-06-17, 5:44:24 PM] ~ Sunan: Didn’t know they had biochem 2
[2024-06-17, 5:44:44 PM] Rameez: You have to take survey of biochem
[2024-06-17, 5:44:49 PM] Rameez: Not biocehm 1 and 2
[2024-06-17, 5:44:59 PM] Rameez: I was just making an example of how biochem classes r hard to get spots for
[2024-06-17, 5:45:17 PM] ~ Sunan: I’m only worried about getting orgo 2 and microbio fall semester
[2024-06-17, 5:45:29 PM] Rameez: Did u take physiology yet
[2024-06-17, 5:45:33 PM] ~ Sunan: Nope
[2024-06-17, 5:45:39 PM] Rameez: Make sure u take that before summer
[2024-06-17, 5:45:43 PM] Rameez: that is a critical mcat class
[2024-06-17, 5:45:50 PM] Rameez: It is a hard class as well
[2024-06-17, 5:45:57 PM] Rameez: all tests average like Cs
[2024-06-17, 5:46:20 PM] ~ Sunan: Why gt professors have such bad ratings
[2024-06-17, 5:46:34 PM] ~ Sunan: All the GSU professors I’ve had have 5/5s

[2024-06-17, 5:48:12 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: A few of them curve grades. I know you might think this is a good thing, but some of them will curve high grades into lower grades if everyone is getting A’s

[2024-06-19, 9:56:38 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: 12-15 credits is a good range
[2024-06-19, 9:56:52 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: so about 4-5 classes

[2024-06-19, 10:15:19 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: I don’t know which classes you would be coming in with, but if you’re doing more intro level courses I would suggest 16-18. Just cuz you have a lot more energy and motivation to study right when you get to tech. Also those classes shouldn’t be as hard as some of the alter coursework so u cna stack them easier
[2024-06-19, 10:15:49 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: That said it’s still not easy, so you gotta kidna find a balance that works for you over time
[2024-06-19, 10:21:58 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: It heavily depends on the classes

[2024-06-19, 10:47:42 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Bro, I don’t know about her teaching recently, but she has a lot of commitment. I had her during Covid, and she would wake up at like 2:00am in India to give us synchronous lectures so that we could ask her questions if we didn’t understand stuff in lecture. Then, I’m pretty sure she got sick with Covid and just posted recorded lectures. She’s also really lenient with students regarding deadlines. I asked her for an extension because my mom was out of town and I had to cook for my other siblings and she basically extended everything 1 week for me.
[2024-06-19, 10:48:07 PM] Tahir: "Rewrite this code with the same behavior but make it 500 lines longer"

[2024-06-19, 10:49:15 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: Credit hours aren’t a great reflection, especially with freshman classes taking so much time. I would say aim for 4 classes, even if that’s only like 13-14 hours.
[2024-06-19, 10:51:21 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: ^ that’s assuming you’re taking classes like Linear algebra, physics, lab sciences, etc.

[2024-06-22, 2:04:05 AM] Rameez: 300/hr or something
[2024-06-22, 2:04:19 AM] ‪+1 (678) 622‑4355‬: pretty sure it’s the standard rate of tuition which is a couple hundred per hour
[2024-06-22, 2:05:05 AM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: “Length of Scholarship Limits
Scholarship eligibility ends when a student attempts 127 credit hours, even if HOPE funds did not pay for those credits. There are no exceptions covering extra hours needed for majors requiring additional hours, for dual-degree programs, or for second majors.”

So does attempted credit hours include like 20 credit hours exempted through AP credit ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-06-22, 2:05:41 AM] ‪+1 (678) 622‑4355‬: no HOPE doesn’t include hours covered from AP/IB credits or DE

[2024-06-22, 6:49:43 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: HOPE covers classes that count for both BS and MS. I’m very certain HOPE also covers MS classes taken as an undergraduate. Once you become a master’s student, HOPE covers nothing, period.

[2024-06-22, 12:48:34 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: ECE 1100 is at an inconvenient time, but otherwise, a solid schedule. I don’t think it’s too busy. Just keep in mind that you won’t want to commute immediately after classes are over because that’s rush hour. You’ll save much more time waiting until like 6:30-7:00 and then returning home if your parents are fine with that.
[2024-06-22, 12:49:13 PM] Tahir: It's also in scheller
[2024-06-22, 12:49:23 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Actually ur gonna be here a lil later, to stay with MSA right ;)

[2024-06-22, 12:50:26 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Buses aren’t that reliable
[2024-06-22, 12:52:01 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: I was referring to staying a little later within the same day. My classes this upcoming semester finish early enough for me to commute using public transportation, so probably no to staying later.
[2024-06-22, 12:52:52 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: You mean MARTA? If you’re talking about Express bus, it drives on the same roads as rush hour traffic, so even that will be slow.

[2024-06-23, 3:54:35 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: cyber good but niche

[2024-06-23, 6:46:52 PM] ~ Zain Ali: Salam guys is CHEM 1310 a requirement for BMED. I’m looking at the requirements and it doesn’t say it, but it seems like it should.
[2024-06-23, 6:47:30 PM] ~ Zain Ali: Perhaps it is a prerequisite to another class listed?
[2024-06-23, 6:50:36 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: I believe it’s a prereq for 1315 or there’s a diff version of chem u have to gake
[2024-06-23, 6:50:53 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: 1315 is Orgo for engineers I think
[2024-06-23, 6:51:47 PM] ~ Zain Ali: Thank you so much- I just found the chem class- similar to 1310 but not the same - thank you!

[2024-06-23, 6:52:38 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Take a look at this resource and also reach out to the advisor for bme he’s actually rlly chill. Prob one of the most useful advisors at tech
[2024-06-23, 6:58:48 PM] Nabeel: Wait who's who

[2024-06-23, 7:02:15 PM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: In theory, this works. In practice, CS roles get so much applicants that most recruiters will reject your application if you aren’t CS. That’s just my experience with CS full time position roles, but it might be different for internships.

[2024-06-23, 8:17:18 PM] ~ Sunan: Sell a kidney while you at it
[2024-06-23, 8:17:45 PM] ~ Sunan: Less likely to get liver failure without the liver 😎
[2024-06-23, 8:18:05 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: do not get mac for engineering
[2024-06-23, 8:18:15 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: my personal reccomendation
[2024-06-23, 8:18:16 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: facts
[2024-06-23, 8:18:21 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: windows better
[2024-06-23, 8:18:33 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: But what about my cute little Apple ecosystem
[2024-06-23, 8:18:54 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I mean idm windows
[2024-06-23, 8:18:57 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: through experience, i bought a mac and i had to loan a windows laptop from IT every semester

[2024-06-23, 8:19:09 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: do not be me
[2024-06-23, 8:19:21 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Maybe my cute little Apple ecosystem isn’t worth it
[2024-06-23, 8:19:26 PM] ~ Sunan: Nah he is right, I had to load a virtual machine so I could use windows applications on my Mac
[2024-06-23, 8:19:36 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Man
[2024-06-23, 8:19:46 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Windows more convenient
[2024-06-23, 8:20:00 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: U know I have a MacBook but the screen broke and I got stuck in windows os
[2024-06-23, 8:20:07 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Cuz I downloaded windows OS for it
[2024-06-23, 8:20:18 PM] ‪+1 (470) 854‑0079‬: Would yall take paper notes or digital ones?

[2024-06-23, 8:20:24 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: for CS it doesnt matter but engineering its windows all the way
[2024-06-23, 8:20:31 PM] ~ Sunan: Lowkey I’d get a Dell XPS if I was doing engineering
[2024-06-23, 8:20:39 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: paper personally but digital convenient i think for most people
[2024-06-23, 8:20:43 PM] ~ Sunan: I use my iPad
[2024-06-23, 8:20:48 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: since u can write directly on slides and make noted and stuff
[2024-06-23, 8:20:54 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Get an iPad aayan we can be iPad buddies
[2024-06-23, 8:20:57 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: i’m an unc so i use paper
[2024-06-23, 8:21:05 PM] ~ Sunan: Who my iPad buddy bruh
[2024-06-23, 8:21:20 PM] ~ Sunan: See I would’ve done that if I didn’t throw away my notes after each semester
[2024-06-23, 8:21:31 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Sunan take diffeq with XYC then we can be iPad buddies
[2024-06-23, 8:21:47 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: lol I have my notes from geometry in 9th grade
[2024-06-23, 8:21:55 PM] ~ Sunan: Only if you take biochem with me
[2024-06-23, 8:22:03 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: 😀
[2024-06-23, 8:22:09 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I think I need regular chem first
[2024-06-23, 8:22:20 PM] ~ Sunan: Nah trust it’s the easier version
[2024-06-23, 8:22:26 PM] ~ Sunan: It’s just half bio half chem
[2024-06-23, 8:22:31 PM] ~ Sunan: And since chem is hard it’s half as hard
[2024-06-23, 8:29:53 PM] ~ Zain Ali: Does it meet all the gt requirements

[2024-06-23, 8:44:28 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Most ME professors use digital learning

[2024-06-23, 9:07:59 PM] Rameez: Solid works and fusion run like butter for me
[2024-06-23, 9:08:44 PM] ~ Zain Ali: I’m not sure I’m leaving that up to my dad
[2024-06-23, 9:09:28 PM] ~ Zain Ali: But I’m also looking at ME just in case, so I suppose windows is better
[2024-06-23, 9:10:16 PM] Rameez: Bmed has maybe 1 program tbat isnt ported for mac but it’s such a trash program you would always use python/matlab anyways
[2024-06-23, 9:24:13 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Bro why r all these laptops so expensive
[2024-06-23, 9:24:30 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I hate rich corporate executives
[2024-06-23, 9:26:59 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: But also for ece 3710 u def need a windows that stuff doesn’t run on a mac
[2024-06-23, 9:29:29 PM] ~ Zain Ali: What do yall think of my planned schedule first semester - PHYS 2211 (I’ve learned introductory physics already, but not AP), MATH 2551 (Math is my strong suit, but this is new territory), ENGL 1101 (I write decently), HIST 2112 (more review), and APPH 1040 or 1050 (gotta learn the science of bulking). Overall 16 credit hours on my first semester. I know that is considered maybe too much, but its really only a couple new classes
[2024-06-23, 9:29:53 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Don’t do apph so early
[2024-06-23, 9:29:57 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Save it for a harder semester
[2024-06-23, 9:30:03 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: But besides that ur chilling
[2024-06-23, 9:30:08 PM] Rameez: Yea
[2024-06-23, 9:30:09 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Not a bad semester at all
[2024-06-23, 9:30:37 PM] ~ Zain Ali: what should I replace APPH with?
[2024-06-23, 9:30:42 PM] Rameez: Nothing
[2024-06-23, 9:30:46 PM] Rameez: Enjoy your first semester
[2024-06-23, 9:30:49 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Idk what credits u have available
[2024-06-23, 9:30:56 PM] Rameez: Its a mistake i made its not fun to do that
[2024-06-23, 9:31:08 PM] Rameez: You need to make friends and get used to this place first
[2024-06-23, 9:31:30 PM] Rameez: And math 2551 is cancer so is physics 1
[2024-06-23, 9:31:42 PM] Rameez: Thats not an easy semester to begin with
[2024-06-23, 9:32:10 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Phys gonna make you kys fyi 😁👍🏼👍🏼
[2024-06-23, 9:32:12 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: lol not rlly
[2024-06-23, 9:32:18 PM] ~ Zain Ali: PHysics 1 i just dynamics, kinematics, circular and rotational motion, relativity, and e &m right?
[2024-06-23, 9:32:27 PM] Rameez: Depends on ur section
[2024-06-23, 9:32:35 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: No e&m or relativity
[2024-06-23, 9:32:42 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Yes but you're gonna get some prof that doesn't speak any English and hates you
[2024-06-23, 9:32:43 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: That’s physics 2
[2024-06-23, 9:33:00 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Also make sure u get intot rh modern physics section
[2024-06-23, 9:33:09 PM] ~ Zain Ali: what is that
[2024-06-23, 9:33:29 PM] Rameez: There’s only modern now
[2024-06-23, 9:33:33 PM] Rameez: They got rid of classical
[2024-06-23, 9:33:38 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Oh that’s good
[2024-06-23, 9:33:43 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Mega w
[2024-06-23, 9:33:47 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Take physics with Greco
[2024-06-23, 9:33:49 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: If u can
[2024-06-23, 9:33:55 PM] ~ Zain Ali: I will try
[2024-06-23, 9:33:58 PM] Rameez: Bruh alecia munoz
[2024-06-23, 9:33:59 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: And then 2551 is fun imo
[2024-06-23, 9:34:12 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Greco is fun to watch lol
[2024-06-23, 9:34:15 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: I don’t learn in class
[2024-06-23, 9:34:56 PM] Rameez: Wait
[2024-06-23, 9:35:04 PM] Rameez: Why arent u taking bmed 1000 or gt 1000
[2024-06-23, 9:35:30 PM] ~ Zain Ali: Muadh said not to in case I switch to mech e
[2024-06-23, 9:36:17 PM] Rameez: Bmed’s biggest advantage is how you can take a minor in CS with only 6 additional hours to your degree. If that’s something you want to do, i would stay
[2024-06-23, 9:36:26 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: He gonna switch to ME
[2024-06-23, 9:36:29 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Sorry rameez

[2024-06-23, 9:37:48 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: This the same dude sleeping in SC3
[2024-06-23, 9:37:53 PM] Rameez: It can replace bmed 1000 for us with a permit that’s why i said or
[2024-06-23, 9:38:00 PM] Rameez: NEVER
[2024-06-23, 9:38:12 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: I have pics don't even

[2024-06-23, 9:38:26 PM] Rameez: Ok 2 years ago you were taking the marta to school
[2024-06-23, 9:38:43 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Also don’t let Muadh tell I what to do when it comes to engineering lol, let me or Rameez tell u
[2024-06-23, 9:38:51 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: I should kill you for that

[2024-06-23, 9:39:40 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: @majd prolly the best smelling guy in SC3
[2024-06-23, 9:39:51 PM] Rameez: Not gonna lie you CAN take math 2551 first semester but you probably want to take a more freshman class cuz your scaling your classes strangely then
[2024-06-23, 9:40:09 PM] Rameez: You have like 5 other prereqs till you get to the classes that require math 2551
[2024-06-23, 9:40:41 PM] ~ Zain Ali: True but I don’t want to forget previous calc classes
[2024-06-23, 9:40:41 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: If u like cells stay bme if u like devices come to ME
[2024-06-23, 9:40:45 PM] Rameez: Like im graduating spring and just got to classes requiring math 2551
[2024-06-23, 9:40:56 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: It’s not that hard calc concepts
[2024-06-23, 9:40:59 PM] Rameez: No previous knowledge is required
[2024-06-23, 9:41:08 PM] ~ Zain Ali: Oh I see
[2024-06-23, 9:41:14 PM] Rameez: Maybe integrstiom by parts and basic integrals/derivstives
[2024-06-23, 9:41:29 PM] ~ Zain Ali: oh thats fine
[2024-06-23, 9:42:18 PM] ~ Zain Ali: I’ll take BME 1000 then and think of substituting 2551 for another class - perhaps CS 1371
[2024-06-23, 9:42:34 PM] Rameez: Take cs 1301
[2024-06-23, 9:42:38 PM] Rameez: Not 1371
[2024-06-23, 9:42:44 PM] Rameez: 1301 counts for bmed
[2024-06-23, 9:42:57 PM] Rameez: Its python and infinitely better
[2024-06-23, 9:43:03 PM] ~ Zain Ali: it says 1371 on gt website
[2024-06-23, 9:43:07 PM] ~ Zain Ali: also is it easier
[2024-06-23, 9:43:09 PM] Rameez: It got changed
[2024-06-23, 9:43:09 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Python >>>>>>>>>
[2024-06-23, 9:43:15 PM] Rameez: No 1371 is harder
[2024-06-23, 9:43:20 PM] ~ Zain Ali: I have no coding experience
[2024-06-23, 9:43:35 PM] ~ Zain Ali: how many credits hrs is 1301
[2024-06-23, 9:43:41 PM] Rameez: Same thing
[2024-06-23, 9:43:44 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Take python its more applicable
[2024-06-23, 9:43:51 PM] ~ Zain Ali: ok
[2024-06-23, 9:44:10 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Don't worry, chatgpt has coding experience 👍🏼👍🏼
[2024-06-23, 9:47:35 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Whatchu know abt 1371 and 2016 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-06-23, 9:49:50 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Only thing is if u rlly gonna consider me, 1370 is an important class for some classes like 2016
[2024-06-23, 9:50:56 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Ya ur rlly gonna need that for MEA
[2024-06-23, 9:51:08 PM] ~ Zain Ali: But don’t I need Calc 3 for linear algebra and diff eq? And will I need those topics earlier?
[2024-06-23, 9:52:25 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: i did calc 3 first and honestly the only thing it did for me was conditioning on how to think in 3D space
[2024-06-23, 9:52:46 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: other than that though the only concept (i remember) that overlapped was dot products
[2024-06-23, 9:53:56 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: No I did linear b4 multi
[2024-06-23, 9:54:21 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: U kidna need multi for diff eq cuz engineers take the 4 credit version but is rlly simple stuff
[2024-06-23, 9:54:32 PM] Rameez: No dont need for either
[2024-06-23, 9:54:39 PM] Rameez: They arent prereqs
[2024-06-23, 9:54:57 PM] Rameez: Theres no order you can take it however u want
[2024-06-23, 9:55:09 PM] Rameez: Take linear instead of multi
[2024-06-23, 9:55:20 PM] Rameez: So english, history, linear, physics 1
[2024-06-23, 9:55:27 PM] Rameez: That would be a good first semester schedule
[2024-06-23, 9:55:34 PM] Rameez: And bmed 100
[2024-06-23, 10:06:02 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: imo linear was harder so i would  do that first

[2024-06-23, 10:06:54 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: i did 1554 not sure for other majors tho
[2024-06-23, 10:07:22 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: 53 for engineers
[2024-06-23, 10:08:32 PM] ~ Zain Ali: What if I want a minor in CS
[2024-06-23, 10:09:41 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Doesn’t matter
[2024-06-23, 10:26:12 PM] ~ Zain Ali: So intro to physics, english 1, US history, BMED 1000, multi or linear
[2024-06-23, 10:26:31 PM] ~ Zain Ali: And I’m assuming that I shouldn’t throw statics in there just for funsies
[2024-06-23, 10:26:37 PM] ~ Zain Ali: because that would be 17 credit hrs
[2024-06-23, 10:26:45 PM] ~ Zain Ali: rather than 15
[2024-06-23, 10:26:49 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: No lol
[2024-06-23, 10:27:03 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Statics is a fun class but not a light one
[2024-06-23, 10:27:24 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Leave it at 15 get accustomed to campus and make time for MSA and MTC
[2024-06-23, 10:27:39 PM] ~ Zain Ali: What is MTC
[2024-06-23, 10:27:52 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: 😱😱

[2024-06-23, 10:28:04 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Idk about that. I think most, if not all, Oreo flavors are trash. I rarely eat them anymore.
[2024-06-23, 10:28:18 PM] ~ Zain Ali: And I’m also obligated (by Muadh) to be involved in MSA after he showed me around campus
[2024-06-23, 10:28:26 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: ^^
[2024-06-23, 10:28:52 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Uk u could jsut maybe be a board member for mtc 🫣
[2024-06-23, 10:31:35 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Don’t take 1554 if you don’t have to. @19452671295 took it as a MechE because his advisor “advised” him. If you’re not CS then don’t do it 😂
[2024-06-23, 10:32:58 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Lowkey keep the first semester manageable in terms of course work because you’ll want to have enough time to meet new people and have the time for new experiences in a new college

[2024-06-23, 11:27:17 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: u kinda have to talk to ur advisor and then submit a form, but b4 u can do that u have to take cs 1331
[2024-06-23, 11:27:28 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: also u have to pick a thread ur interested in
[2024-06-23, 11:29:13 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I should have AP credit for 1331 I think

[2024-06-26, 11:04:09 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: That’s odd. Didn’t even see anything about it when I looked it up online. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-06-26, 11:04:26 AM] Sualeh: No
[2024-06-26, 11:04:35 AM] Sualeh: Just relieve some tire pressure if you're having issues
[2024-06-26, 11:04:42 AM] Sualeh: Make sure it's according to the owners manual
[2024-06-26, 11:04:59 AM] Sualeh: It may not be a sensor issue at all tbh
[2024-06-26, 11:05:11 AM] Sualeh: Every time I think it's a tire sensor issue it's an issue with calibration
[2024-06-26, 11:05:21 AM] Sualeh: On my Honda, 2017
[2024-06-26, 11:05:27 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: I think I’m starting to realize that now
[2024-06-26, 11:05:40 AM] Sualeh: Make sure that after you reset tire pressure
[2024-06-26, 11:05:42 AM] Sualeh: You check PSI
[2024-06-26, 11:05:57 AM] Sualeh: There's a sticker in the driver's side door jamb and it'll tell you what to fill them up to
[2024-06-26, 11:06:01 AM] Sualeh: After you do that
[2024-06-26, 11:06:05 AM] ~ Omar Jaafar: 👍
[2024-06-26, 11:06:08 AM] Sualeh: Make sure to recalibrate the TPMS
[2024-06-26, 11:06:45 AM] Sualeh: If the issue persists
[2024-06-26, 11:06:51 AM] Sualeh: Recalibrate about 5 times
[2024-06-26, 11:07:55 AM] Sualeh: If it still don't work I've heard bad alignment can also be a cause but idk how, unless it's just atrocious alignment
[2024-06-26, 11:08:06 AM] Sualeh: Mb I didn't tell you this earlier I was locked in for an exam
[2024-06-26, 11:08:16 AM] ~ Sunan: Hondas don’t have tpms sensors, they started using wheelspin sensors instead, you still have to reset the “tpms” sensors which is just the car knowing that you checked the tire pressure and so it’ll use that as a reference
[2024-06-26, 11:08:26 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: You good
[2024-06-26, 11:08:36 AM] Sualeh: What year did they start this?
[2024-06-26, 11:08:45 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: That’s what I found out yesterday
[2024-06-26, 11:08:50 AM] ~ Sunan: My 2020 has it and so did my 2018
[2024-06-26, 11:09:15 AM] Sualeh: I see
[2024-06-26, 11:09:20 AM] ~ Sunan: On bright side whenever I go to get new tires they can’t charge me for a new sensor
[2024-06-26, 11:09:36 AM] Sualeh: The option still says calibrate tpms so I thought it had it
[2024-06-26, 11:09:42 AM] ~ Sunan: But I can’t see individual tire pressures either so I have to carry a pressure gauge with me
[2024-06-26, 11:09:43 AM] Sualeh: Good to know
[2024-06-26, 11:10:07 AM] Sualeh: Yeah I think it's usually a good idea to carry a simple, mechanical, calibrated pressure gauge with you
[2024-06-26, 11:10:07 AM] ~ Sunan: I always end up calibrating 2-3 times before the light finally goes away

[2024-06-30, 6:43:13 AM] ‪+1 (678) 327‑6601‬: - Been working part time jobs in retail since I was like 16
- Graduated HS in Lilburn in 2020
- Worked part-time jobs throughout college to pay tuition off at GSU while pursuing BS of CS but never got an internship, co-op, etc.
- Graduated from GSU May ‘23
- Got a job as a Junior Business Analyst in Cybersecurity Sept ‘23 after months of cold applying, networking, reaching to recruiters etc (a brother who was an alumni of GT & GSU put me on ‎الحمد لله)
- Worked until Jan 2024 then got laid off/contract cut short. 
- Worked for my local masjid Darul Arqam/Najam Institute from then till like month 
- Current back in the job search market looking to get a job in tech while pursuing my OMSCS in ML at GT

TLDR: Job Searching is tough and gets even harder for some once they graduate from uni, use as much time as y’all can to network while you have access to all the resources the school provides like career fairs, internship programs, etc. Do NOT procrastinate in college boys

I was at GSU from 2020-2023 and in the 2022-2023 school year, we had a really successful dawah table every Tuesday and Thursday with the msaatgsu. We had like 10-15 shahadas and a lot of positive conversations inviting non-muslim college students to Islam ‎الحمد لله

Sheikh Anwar Arafat came to masjid IC Nur that same year and many of us did dawah training with him and learned about the G.O.R.A.P method. Goated way of giving dawah. In the past two years alone, I’ve been blessed with giving over 10 shahadas ‎الحمد لله.

[2024-07-03, 7:57:40 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: A minor doesn’t help with professional opportunities unless you expand outside of class work with research or projects. If you are interested in your minor and would likely work on it outside of class, declaring a minor will help you register for those classes (without the minor you’ll have major restrictions). Keep in mind that your minor doesn’t show up on your physical degree (only your transcript), and you may be required to take 1-2 classes you aren’t interested in in order to meet credit hour qualifications for the minor.

[2024-07-07, 2:48:23 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: There’s a park-and-ride off Indian Trail with a bus route ending at Civic Center station, if you’re interested. You can take a northbound train from there to Midtown station and catch the shuttle to campus.

[2024-07-07, 2:54:34 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Wayakum. Idk if Tech sells monthly passes for Ride Gwinnett, but if you purchase directly from Ride Gwinnett, it’s $130. The commute from Indian Trail Park and Ride to Midtown station should be about 40-50 minutes, given there’s no major traffic jams. And then factor in the time it takes to catch the shuttle to campus. ‎<This message was edited>

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3961945548
[2024-07-13, 11:17:21 AM] Sualeh: Ayatul kursi is never a bad thing to read, but indeed would be an innovation if it is considered to protect you once you leave the house, provided there are no authentic narrations regarding it. Along with that the dua Yusuf mentioned, which is authentically narrated, there is another dua from the Quran that is to be read when travelling any distance. Inshallah those two paired are a great habit to make.

Alhumdulillah though, may Allah give @17634012151 and his family complete shifa❤️

[2024-07-16, 3:44:02 PM] Sualeh: Salam
Is anyone still looking for housing or a roommate near campus this semester? (Offer only open if you're a god fearing women)
[2024-07-16, 3:45:45 PM] Rameez: ✋
[2024-07-16, 4:16:20 PM] ~ Abdulaziz Memesh: There's a math minor, but there's no statistics major or minor
I think you should consider double majoring with math if you can pull that off since it's only an additional 36 credit hours
[2024-07-16, 4:25:15 PM] Sualeh: Do a math minor, it's usually a great idea
[2024-07-16, 4:25:18 PM] Sualeh: If you actually like math
[2024-07-16, 4:25:38 PM] Sualeh: Don't decide on doing a math minor until after you've taken up until multivariable calculus
[2024-07-16, 4:37:05 PM] ~ Yameen Ahmed: I heard the counselors don't encourage that
[2024-07-16, 4:37:35 PM] ~ Yameen Ahmed: That seems reasonable, I have just finished up MATH 2550, and it wasn't that bad for me
[2024-07-16, 4:37:49 PM] ~ Yameen Ahmed: I'll look into the minor thank you
[2024-07-16, 4:37:59 PM] Sualeh: Double major is honestly the only way to reliabily get a job with a CS degree straight out of undergrad
[2024-07-16, 4:38:10 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Wa alaykum assalam 
No

[2024-07-16, 4:44:38 PM] Sualeh: But pretty much any other useful thing
[2024-07-16, 4:48:43 PM] Rameez: If youre wanting a SWE job, leetcode, projects, masters degrees, and internships far outrank double majors and minors in that sense. To get into a more math heavy CS field, research related to it would be an easier avenue. The math minor may help solidify your knowledge to amplify these other skills but it wont have a direct benefit if that was what you were going for. Most minors besides the premed ones or CS ones (for non CS majors) are overrated ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-07-16, 4:57:33 PM] Adam: Idk applied math is pretty sought after…stats, applied math, and then CS were the most common majors for people pursing masters in ML

[2024-07-16, 4:59:49 PM] Sualeh: A minor won't get you those skills and a math double major atleast from what I've heard, tailors to a very specific niche of CS jobs that aren't very available
[2024-07-16, 5:00:20 PM] Adam: Idk man. ML is pretty available
[2024-07-16, 5:00:49 PM] Sualeh: I didn't know people do a math double major for ML

[2024-07-18, 1:07:57 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: This is what happens when nationality becomes more important to the country than Islam
[2024-07-18, 1:10:25 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Respectfully that is not the issue here
[2024-07-18, 1:11:35 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: The protests have nothing to do w nationality or pride in nationality, it’s about students wanting jobs that are merit based
[2024-07-18, 1:11:54 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: And the police brutality not allowing them to peaceful protest and giving back harsh treatment
[2024-07-18, 1:12:06 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: But the reason it isn’t merit based is because they’re dedicating that to descendants revolutionary fighters no?
[2024-07-18, 1:12:48 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: I suppose so, I didn’t consider this angle however it’s more about the government and their decisions
[2024-07-18, 1:12:58 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Although I see how pride in the nation can play into that
[2024-07-18, 1:13:01 PM] Nabeel: I think it's less than nationality, it's just state-sponsored nepotism

[2024-07-18, 1:13:25 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: They’re masking it in nationality
[2024-07-18, 1:13:31 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: And making pejorative remarks as such
[2024-07-18, 1:13:39 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: But it’s rly about nepotism I agree
[2024-07-18, 1:13:40 PM] Nabeel: If it was at least about nationality, they would cater to what's best for the nation

[2024-07-24, 10:13:20 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: If I remember correctly, the volunteers are supposed to clock in at the Howey Physics Building.

[2024-07-24, 10:16:02 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: It’s not too bad

[2024-07-24, 10:16:19 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: If u want Ig
[2024-07-24, 10:16:32 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: It all depends on which rail line ur taking
[2024-07-24, 10:16:49 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Red, gold, green, blue
[2024-07-24, 10:17:48 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: The red and gold lines are the busier rail lines cuz they go straight to the airport, so u may see the train being very crowded at times.
[2024-07-24, 10:18:30 AM] ‪+1 (678) 900‑2064‬: I’ll be taking gold most likely

[2024-07-24, 10:19:20 AM] ‪+1 (678) 900‑2064‬: I’m coming strapped
[2024-07-24, 10:20:12 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Good luck if ur driving to the Doraville station. There’s been construction going on on Buford Hwy for a while now and I don’t think it’s been paved. So ur probs in for a bumpy ride.
[2024-07-24, 10:21:28 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: I speak from experience as I’ve occasionally driven by Buford Hwy on Jimmy Carter and seen the construction myself. And also I had to endure the bumpiness (sorta) when I took the 10A/B from Doraville to Gwinnett Place.
[2024-07-24, 10:22:45 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: So @16789002064, if the Sugarloaf Mills Park and Ride isn’t too far of a drive from ur house, u could park ur car there and take the 10A/B to the Doraville station.
[2024-07-24, 10:23:09 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Oh wait, nvm
[2024-07-24, 10:23:19 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: You gotta be at Tech real early
[2024-07-24, 10:23:27 AM] ‪+1 (678) 900‑2064‬: Yeah I can park at Doraville or Chamblee
[2024-07-24, 10:23:51 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Good luck on the gold line
[2024-07-24, 10:24:10 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: The blue line’s not bad either btw
[2024-07-24, 10:24:41 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: If the Kensington station isn’t too far from ur house, that’s another option.
[2024-07-24, 10:26:38 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: A good tip tho @16789002064: sit in the same car as the train operator. I used to sit towards the middle/back of the train, but that was an L.
[2024-07-24, 10:36:14 AM] ‪+1 (678) 900‑2064‬: Gotcha thanks man appreciate the tips
[2024-07-24, 10:36:23 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Fs
[2024-07-24, 10:37:20 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: And if the seats right behind the operator’s cab are free, go for them.

[2024-07-24, 11:29:35 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: I personally didn’t have any summer classes. I was pretty much chilling at home the whole day. But I unexpectedly had to head over to Johns Creek like every week or 2 weeks or sumn. The drive there from Gwinnett is not fun (well, it sorta is). I also attended a nikkah reception in Alpharetta back in May (it coincidentally was 2 days before my birthday) and afterwards had some time to chill at Avalon. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-08-02, 12:09:24 AM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: The process is called Flanderization, after the character “Flanders” from the Simpsons. To say that a character has become a caricature of itself is to say that his or her personality traits have become exaggerated, distorted to the point of being absurd.

[2024-08-02, 12:09:57 AM] ‪+1 (678) 327‑6601‬: Flanderization is a term used in media and literature to describe the process by which a character's traits become exaggerated to the point of being overly simplistic and stereotypical. This often occurs over time in long-running series, where initially well-rounded characters are reduced to a few key characteristics or catchphrases. The term originates from the character Ned Flanders from the TV show "The Simpsons," who started as a nuanced neighbor but became increasingly defined by his extreme religiosity and cheerfulness. Flanderization can lead to a loss of depth and complexity in characters, making them less relatable and more predictable.

[2024-08-04, 10:40:58 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Even more worth it because they’re closing down Brittain so dining halls will prolly be crowded

[2024-08-04, 11:06:45 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Dining dollars are on your buzzcard too
[2024-08-04, 11:06:57 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: And u can use them on the vending machines as well
[2024-08-05, 6:13:21 AM] Nabeel: Wa alaikum assalam, where all the CSE people at?
[2024-08-05, 6:15:05 AM] Nabeel: As for the Intel thread, you don't really need a crazy computer for the 3000s courses, but some 4000s courses benefit from having a good gpu (for which your best bet is getting a PC and an NVIDIA card)
[2024-08-05, 6:16:01 AM] Nabeel: If what you sent is your budget, just shoot for something with good portability IMO
[2024-08-05, 6:16:55 AM] Nabeel: And don't worry about GPU because you can always use compute services (some of which the school offers too)
[2024-08-05, 6:17:29 AM] Nabeel: I haven't done modsim myself, but I'd expect similar
[2024-08-05, 8:28:34 AM] Abdurrahman Tabaa: If you don’t need it for food, I would say only have like $10 on there for emergency snacks or vending machines. You don’t need to pay for printing or the gym (CRC) if you’re a full time student. If you’re printing large posters at the library, you’ll need to pay, but you’ll have plenty of time to put money in your buzzcard before then if you ever need to print a large poster.

[2024-08-05, 11:39:02 AM] Nabeel: It would probably fit
[2024-08-05, 11:40:38 AM] Suleyman Galloway: like having just simply no debt or banks that don't charge month by month fees?
[2024-08-05, 11:52:12 AM] ~ Abdullah: Banks that don’t deal with interest
[2024-08-05, 11:52:27 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: I don’t think such a thing exists
[2024-08-05, 11:52:30 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: In the U.S
[2024-08-05, 11:52:35 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: That's an oxymoron

[2024-08-05, 11:53:18 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Just have multiple checking account. Not a savings
[2024-08-05, 11:53:18 AM] Suleyman Galloway: best way to deal with it is have both a checking and savings account, keep debt only in debit, not credit accounts, and pay debit/cash wherever u go
[2024-08-05, 11:54:03 AM] ~ Abdullah: Wym
[2024-08-05, 11:54:15 AM] ~ Abdullah: Debt is good?
[2024-08-05, 11:54:21 AM] ~ Abdullah: Elaborate
[2024-08-05, 11:54:23 AM] Suleyman Galloway: debt is not good
[2024-08-05, 11:54:26 AM] ~ Abdullah: Bet
[2024-08-05, 11:54:28 AM] Suleyman Galloway: but debt is hard to avoid
[2024-08-05, 11:54:29 AM] Muqaddar: Checking doesn’t bring interest
[2024-08-05, 11:54:43 AM] Suleyman Galloway: so if you have debt do not use credit for debt
[2024-08-05, 11:54:43 AM] ~ Abdullah: What’s point of multiple tho
[2024-08-05, 11:54:57 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: One for saving
[2024-08-05, 11:55:04 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: ^
[2024-08-05, 11:55:17 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Cuz an actual saving acc has interest
[2024-08-05, 11:55:18 AM] Muqaddar: Idk alley on a different level cause I only got one 😭😭
[2024-08-05, 11:55:32 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: Nah same 😂😂

[2024-08-05, 11:55:54 AM] ~ Abdullah: Just save in regular?
[2024-08-05, 11:55:59 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: Two checking accounts, one will act as a traditional checking, other can act as a “savings” but without interest
[2024-08-05, 11:56:01 AM] Suleyman Galloway: it does?
[2024-08-05, 11:56:20 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Yes

[2024-08-05, 11:57:18 AM] Suleyman Galloway: BarakAllahu feek
[2024-08-05, 11:57:28 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Only having one checking account is dangerous because if your information gets stolen, all your money is gone. And Banks don't refund stolen money for checking account like they usually would for a credit card (credit cards are a banks money so they fight harder for it lol)
[2024-08-05, 11:57:34 AM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Wa allaikum assalam
[2024-08-05, 11:57:40 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: i’d say avoid credit cards but unfortunately in this country u cant do anything without credit
[2024-08-05, 11:57:48 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: so perhaps just use it sparingly and make sure to pay off on time
[2024-08-05, 11:57:57 AM] Suleyman Galloway: its fine to have a credit card but never use it
[2024-08-05, 11:58:08 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: 😢
[2024-08-05, 11:58:23 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: then whats the point of the card lol
[2024-08-05, 11:58:31 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: if u dont use it do u still build credit?
[2024-08-05, 11:58:49 AM] Suleyman Galloway: well not "never" but use it very sparingly
[2024-08-05, 11:59:09 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: ya that’s what i said
[2024-08-05, 11:59:12 AM] Suleyman Galloway: the less u use it (only for paying off things or mandatory expenses) the higher your credit will be
[2024-08-05, 11:59:17 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: ye
[2024-08-05, 11:59:17 AM] Muqaddar: You can use a credit card and never get interest on it
[2024-08-05, 11:59:19 AM] Mirza Zuhayr: makes sense
[2024-08-05, 12:01:18 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: The problem with a credit card is you "agree" to pay interest if you miss a payment
[2024-08-05, 12:01:48 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Technically if you always pay it. There's no interest. Different fatwas and different madhabs have different answers. Depends on who you follow
[2024-08-05, 12:02:33 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: But @16782964137 unless you're planning on cash for everything. Every bank operates on interest. But opening a checking out, you should be fine.
[2024-08-05, 12:29:46 PM] Sualeh: Around 3% utilization rate is ideal
[2024-08-05, 12:29:58 PM] Sualeh: Although anything below 30 will cause your credit to go up

[2024-08-05, 1:38:11 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I’ve seen some people say you can use a credit card in necessary situations (like building credit)
[2024-08-05, 1:38:27 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: But once it is built/maintained it would be haraam to use it
[2024-08-05, 1:40:09 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: The issue is you have to maintain life long credit. It always has to have *some* usage on it
[2024-08-05, 1:40:29 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Not exactly sure but I'd ask a local sheikh
[2024-08-05, 1:40:48 PM] ~ Aley El-Olemy: Some say that the terms themselves are ridiculous and most don't actually read them so they don't agree to it yk

[2024-08-13, 5:24:26 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: It would still be haraam to put it outside because Ali RA said in an authentic hadith, “Shall I not send you upon the mission with which the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, sent me? Do not leave a graven image but that you efface it, and do not leave a built over grave but that you level it.”

[2024-08-13, 5:29:20 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: The Hadith is general so it would include both the dead and the living

[2024-08-14, 3:21:13 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: APPH will have 0 impact aside from maybe an hour a week
[2024-08-14, 3:21:37 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: it’s doable but you’ll have to lock in for sure
[2024-08-14, 3:24:54 PM] ~ Hadi Syed: Cs 1100 is the hardest I think

[2024-08-14, 3:31:18 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: personally when i took 1332 i never went to lecture and only watched HBs videos and went to recitation which saved me a lot of time. I spent maybe 4 hours a week learning and another 4 hours doing the hw and reviewing. So i would say around 10 hours a week on 1332 just to be safe
[2024-08-14, 3:31:24 PM] ~ Yameen Ahmed: Yeah

[2024-08-23, 3:56:32 PM] ‪+1 (404) 583‑1415‬: Hey guys I made promise to God that if I‘d get this class that I would tell you this:
My registration situation was very very difficult this semester and I almost got no classes because my credits for pre requisite classes from another institution wouldn‘t get transferred in time, so I wouldn’t be able to take these classes. And after a lot of back and forth and despair over two weeks I got a permit to take the classes I wanted without the transcript transferred yet. At first the classes were empty, but once I get a permit everything was full. Until this morning, something opened up, but then it turned out, that I need to register for multiple sections in that class which were already full. So I thought that it was over since today is the last day of registration. I checked the whole day, and everything was full. Until just 40 minutes ago, a new section was opened so I could register. However, the permit didn‘t apply to that section so I couldn‘t register again. After calling my advisor and him not responding, I ran to his office to get a permit for that section too. Just as he was about to give it to me, Oscar went down. But 1000x Alhamdulillah, in the end it worked and I got it.
The reason I am telling you this is because this is a sign for all of you not to lose hope in Allah. Nothing happens without his will. I am convinced that only the sincere duas I made until the very last moment got me in. Make dua, God wants you for return to him and to seek him. And never lose hope in him, for he said in the Quran, that only the people of disbelievers lose hope in the Almighty

[2024-08-25, 2:39:07 PM] ‪+1 (678) 899‑8468‬: Are you sure she actually thinks it is a real depiction, there are many historical depictions of the prophet and as a history professor its not suprising that she would show depictions for educational purposes

I am not defending it, depicting the prophet is absolutely haram no doubt, but if she is not a Muslim then she wouldnt really care
[2024-08-25, 2:40:11 PM] ‪+1 (678) 899‑8468‬: And i agree, as a professor she should know that this is not acceptable, she should have known not to do that

[2024-08-25, 2:43:57 PM] ~ Hassan Sheikh: In the book we had to read it had a “picture” of the prophet
[2024-08-25, 2:46:06 PM] ‪+1 (678) 899‑8468‬: You didnt understand what i said, there are numerous depictions of the prophet in history

Again, it is absolutely haram but professors (not defending them) for "educational" purposes will show such depictions to provide perspective.

Not supporting it, but I highly doubt she would think that is a true depiction, just a depiction that some people back then may thought was true and to supposedly provide perspective on said people
[2024-08-25, 2:47:13 PM] ‪+1 (678) 899‑8468‬: Maybe I misunderstood if that was sarcasm mb lol. Sorry
[2024-08-25, 2:50:50 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: that’s not the issue tho. whether or not she believes in the accuracy of the depiction or not, any depiction is haram. she should be culturally sensitive as a history prof with a PhD
[2024-08-25, 2:51:47 PM] Adam: Hmmmm I see. Tbh when she showed it she explicitly stated beforehand that she knows it’s a controversial thing to show pictures of the prophet and then when she went to the next slide it was just a comparison of Isa (as) and Muhammad (saw). Like things/tools they used (carpenter vs shepheard, donkey vs camel, etc) and then generated pictures side by side for comparison. 

I think u can gain a lot of perspective on a historical figure without having to see their face. Knowing beforehand that it’s not allowed in the religion yet still showing it is kinda retarded given that this person clearly has an education background. ‎<This message was edited>

I notice that a lot of the brothers here celebrate birthdays and I’m not trynna be an unc lol but I believe it’s best that we as Muslims shouldn’t celebrate birthdays as they have pagan origins and are heavily practiced by satanists as one of the highest satanic rituals. 

I understand that we all come from different backgrounds and levels of Islamic study but once I learned this, I myself stopped celebrating birthdays. I’m not here to debate but Lmk what yall think.

[2024-08-31, 12:09:30 AM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Sufism is too broad of a term to generically say is bid3ah or shirk or permissible so just take from what is confirmed from the sunnah

[2024-09-03, 12:09:14 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Allah (glorified and exalted be He) has supernumerary angels who rove about seeking out gatherings in which Allah's name is being invoked: they sit with them and fold their wings round each other, filling that which is between them and between the lowest heaven. When [the people in the gathering] depart, [the angels] ascend and rise up to heaven. He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said: Then Allah (mighty and sublime be He) asks them - [though] He is most knowing about them: From where have you come? And they say: We have come from some servants of Yours on Earth: they were glorifying You (Subhana llah), exalting you (Allahu akbar), witnessing that there is no god but You (La ilaha illa llah), praising You (Al-Hamdu lillah), and asking [favours] of You. He says: And what do they ask of Me? They say: They ask of You Your Paradise. He says: And have they seen My Paradise? They say: No, O Lord. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Paradise! They say: And they ask protection of You. He says: From what do they ask protection of Me? They say: From Your Hell-fire, O Lord. He says: And have they seen My Hell-fire? They say: NO. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Hell-fire: They say: And they ask for Your forgiveness. He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) said: Then He says: I have forgiven them and I have bestowed upon them what they have asked for, and I have granted them sanctuary from that from which they asked protection. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said: They say: O Lord, among them is So-and-so, a much sinning servant, who was merely passing by and sat down with them. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said: And He says: And to him [too] I have given forgiveness: he who sits with such people shall not suffer.
It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, at-Tirmidhi, and an-Nasa'i).

[2024-09-03, 9:48:31 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: A little constructive criticism for announcing the salat times: let others know what the agreed upon salat time is cuz I’ve been seeing some ppl sending out different times for one particular salat (eg. dhuhr 1) and I feel like that could confuse some ppl. Not that I don’t pray at GT, but I felt like I could help u guys fine tune these announcements.
[2024-09-03, 9:49:09 PM] Junaid: The reason why there are different salat times is becuase there are multiple Jummuah throughout the day
[2024-09-03, 9:49:55 PM] Junaid: Labeling the number allows us to understand which Jummah we are praying and its just a good fair update and gives everyone a chance to earn higher rewards.

[2024-09-03, 9:52:06 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Let me rephrase what I’ve said: maybe instead of labeling the salat 1.5 and so on, do whole numbers only.
[2024-09-03, 9:52:09 PM] Junaid: Good thing to note tho for those who are unsure on how we run the salat campus thing
[2024-09-03, 9:57:24 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: The 0.5s is just for fun ig but it’s bc they do jamat at times before the previously announced time
[2024-09-03, 9:57:31 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: So technically it wouldn’t be duhr 3 or 1
[2024-09-03, 9:57:37 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: so in between 1 and 2
[2024-09-03, 9:57:55 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Kinda figured it was for fun, but good to know anyway

[2024-09-03, 9:58:24 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: I think ppl will get used to it
[2024-09-03, 9:58:32 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: I don’t think the number matters as much as the time anyway
[2024-09-03, 9:58:44 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: As long as u know a jamat is happen
[2024-09-03, 9:58:45 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: happening

[2024-09-04, 1:00:13 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: But what if the prof makes attendance mandatory?
[2024-09-04, 1:00:13 PM] Ishaq: tbh it starts out like that but then you just start coping

[2024-09-04, 1:03:12 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: for me it helps to go to class cuz its just another time im seeing or hearing the information at least. Even if im not fully paying attention
[2024-09-04, 1:03:42 PM] Ishaq: also this
[2024-09-04, 1:03:51 PM] Sualeh: Yes
[2024-09-04, 1:04:13 PM] ~ Adam B.: yeah depends on the person and the class too. I keep up by doing the hw on my own, so it forces me to learn the content before
[2024-09-04, 1:04:16 PM] Sualeh: And if you pay attention in class, at least in the majority of cases it can save you tons of time
[2024-09-04, 1:05:22 PM] Rameez: 😭😭😭😭 bruh

[2024-09-04, 1:07:54 PM] ~ Adam B.: yeah depends on the person ig and the class. Like in bio and chem I learned a lot in class by paying attention, but in all my math classes I never learned a thing in class I'd instantly get lost 😭
[2024-09-04, 1:08:20 PM] Sualeh: I won't do dawah but I'll argue with em
[2024-09-04, 1:09:02 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Lol me and Tahir listened to him and then as we walked past him he said “Some people think Jesus is a prophet! But he is not!”

[2024-09-06, 9:28:08 AM] ~ ahmet korkaya: Salam brothers, I wanna share this fundraiser campaign for a living stipend for up to 200 medical students from Gaza who have lost everything because of the genocide. This was organized by many medical students (both american and Palestinian). I know you’re all broke so I’m not expecting big donations BUT if any of your parents or relatives want a place to donate maybe they can consider helping the future self-determination of Palestinians by helping fund their doctors in training! Please share widely if you can habibis and betas.
[2024-09-06, 9:39:53 AM] ~ ahmet korkaya: and if all else fails you could at least share our insta post!

[2024-09-07, 8:17:10 PM] Muadh: Assalamu Alaikum brothers
A lot of the MSA brothers are planning to attend Fajr at Farooq regularly from now on. I urge all of you to join us as it will be a beautiful experience  allowing us to get closer to Allah and our Deen through each other and strengthen our bonds within this community.
I understand that it is easier to pray at home, but the reward of congregation is much much greater. And that too for Fajr for which Rasool SAW said, "The two Rakahs of Fajr are better than the world and all it contains." (Sahih Muslim)

So Insha Allah let us all set our alarms, remind each other and get together for the sake of Allah tomorrow. 
Insha Allah we may even regularly hit the gym and breakfast right after too before going to classes. 
It will set an amazing tone for the day Insha Allah, and Allah will discipline and energise you in ways you won't even realize through out the day within all your affairs adding His Rahma and Barakah to them.

I hope to see you all at Farooq tomorrow morning Insha Allah. The Athan is at 6:06 am currently, and the Iqamah is at 6:30 pm for Masjid Farooq. (It will get updated regularly and can be checked from the website)

Let's do this together brothers Insha Allah! Jazakum Allahu Khairan

[2024-09-08, 4:57:39 PM] Tahir: @13135550002 tell me the story of Hamzah the strongest man on the Pni committee
[2024-09-08, 4:57:42 PM] Meta AI: Here's a story about Hamzah, the strongest man on the PNI committee:

Hamzah was a towering figure, standing at 6'5" with a broad chest and arms that seemed chiseled from granite. But his physical strength was only matched by his kindness and compassion.

As a member of the PNI committee, Hamzah was always the first to volunteer for any task that required physical labor. He would effortlessly lift heavy boxes, move furniture, and even help with construction projects.

One day, the committee decided to organize a charity event to raise funds for a local orphanage. Hamzah took charge of setting up the venue, using his incredible strength to move tables, chairs, and even a massive stage.

As the event began, Hamzah was everywhere, ensuring everything ran smoothly. He even helped cook and serve food, using his powerful arms to stir massive pots of stew.

But Hamzah's greatest feat came when a sudden storm hit, threatening to destroy the event. With lightning-fast reflexes, he single-handedly held down a massive tent, keeping it from flying away.

The crowd gasped in awe as Hamzah stood firm, his muscles bulging with effort. The storm passed, and the event continued, thanks to Hamzah's heroics.

From that day on, Hamzah was known as the strongest man on the PNI committee, a true champion of kindness and strength. His legendary feats inspired others to follow in his footsteps, making the committee an unstoppable force for good. 💪🏽🌟 ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 4:58:56 PM] Meta AI: There are valid concerns about the potential risks and downsides of using AI. Here are some reasons why we should be cautious and responsible in our use of AI:

1. *Bias and discrimination*: AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases if they're trained on biased data.

2. *Job displacement*: AI automation could displace human workers, particularly in sectors where tasks are repetitive or can be easily automated.

3. *Privacy concerns*: AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, which can raise concerns about privacy and surveillance.

4. *Lack of transparency and accountability*: AI decision-making processes can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how decisions are made.

5. *Dependence on technology*: Over-reliance on AI could erode human skills and abilities.

6. *Existential risks*: Some experts worry about the potential for superintelligent AI to pose an existential risk to humanity.

To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to develop and use AI responsibly, with careful consideration of ethical implications, transparency, and human oversight. ‎<This message was edited>

The Finance Committee is the unsung hero of every organization. Without their financial expertise and management, no committee can achieve its goals. They are the backbone of every success, providing the necessary resources to make things happen.

Every committee relies on the Finance Committee for:

- _Funding_: They provide the necessary funds to execute events, projects, and initiatives.
- _Budgeting_: They help create realistic budgets, ensuring committees stay on track financially.
- _Financial guidance_: They offer expert advice on financial matters, preventing costly mistakes.

Without the Finance Committee's support, committees would struggle to:

- _Host events_: No funds for venues, catering, or equipment.
- _Launch projects_: No budget for resources, materials, or personnel.
- _Achieve goals_: No financial guidance to make informed decisions.

The Finance Committee's role is vital, enabling every other committee to succeed. They are the foundation upon which all successes are built. Let's appreciate their hard work and dedication to keeping our organization financially healthy and thriving!" ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:00:57 PM] Meta AI: Thank you for sharing information about the Muslim Students' Association (MSA). Yes, taking the Shahada ( declaration of faith) is a fundamental step in embracing Islam and joining the Muslim community. The Shahada is a profound statement that declares:

"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."

By reciting the Shahada, one affirms their belief in the oneness of God (Tawhid) and accepts Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final messenger. This declaration marks the beginning of a person's journey in Islam, and it's a beautiful moment of spiritual growth.

If you have any questions or need guidance on Islam or the MSA, feel free to ask! ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:01:52 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: @13135550002 if you could chose any religion based on the criteria of which is most consistent and logically sound what is the choice you’d make?
[2024-09-08, 5:01:53 PM] Meta AI: I don't have personal preferences or beliefs, but I can provide an analysis of various religions based on consistency and logical soundness. However, it's essential to note that religions often involve faith, spirituality, and personal experiences, which can't be solely evaluated through logical consistency.

That being said, some argue that Islam is a religion that is logically sound and consistent. Here are a few reasons why:

1. *Tawhid* (Monotheism): Islam's core belief in one God, without associates or partners, is a simple and consistent concept.
2. *Clear moral guidelines*: Islam provides a comprehensive moral framework, with clear dos and don'ts, promoting a balanced and virtuous life.
3. *Coherent narrative*: The Quran presents a consistent narrative, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and its message is reinforced by the Hadith (Prophetic traditions).
4. *Emphasis on reason and intellect*: Islam encourages critical thinking, reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge.
5. *Consistency in rituals and practices*: Islamic rituals, like the Five Daily Prayers, are consistent and provide a sense of structure and discipline.

However, it's crucial to remember that every religion has its unique aspects, and what may seem logically sound to one person might not be the same for another. Ultimately, religious beliefs are deeply personal and often involve emotional, spiritual, and cultural factors. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:02:09 PM] Hamza Zahid: @13135550002 why don't we join all religions
[2024-09-08, 5:02:11 PM] Meta AI: Joining all religions might seem like an inclusive approach, but it's not feasible for several reasons:

1. *Core beliefs*: Each religion has unique core beliefs, values, and practices that might contradict others.
2. *Doctrinal differences*: Merging religions would require reconciling conflicting doctrines, which could lead to a loss of authenticity and identity.
3. *Practical challenges*: Combining rituals, practices, and traditions from various religions could create confusion and logistical issues.
4. *Loss of cultural significance*: Religions are often deeply rooted in specific cultures and histories; blending them might dilute their cultural significance.
5. *Individual identity*: People often strongly identify with a particular religion; combining religions could lead to a loss of personal identity and community.

Instead of joining all religions, we can focus on:

1. *Interfaith dialogue*: Encourage open discussions to promote understanding and respect.
2. *Shared values*: Emphasize common values like compassion, kindness, and justice.
3. *Coexistence*: Foster a culture of mutual respect and acceptance.
4. *Education*: Learn about different religions to dispel misconceptions and appreciate their unique aspects.

By embracing diversity and promoting understanding, we can create a harmonious and inclusive environment for people of all faiths. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:02:32 PM] Meta AI: The text "ا ل ل ه ا ك ب ر" is Arabic, and it translates to "Allahu Akbar" in English.

"Allahu Akbar" is a common Islamic phrase that means "God is the greatest" or "Allah is the greatest." It's often used as:

- An expression of gratitude and praise to Allah
- A declaration of faith and trust in Allah's power and wisdom
- A phrase to invoke Allah's name in times of struggle or joy

In Islamic tradition, "Allahu Akbar" is also used as a formal call to prayer, a way to begin prayers, and a phrase to express excitement or surprise. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:03:30 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: @13135550002 who’s the goat in the Georgia Tech MSA?
[2024-09-08, 5:03:33 PM] Meta AI: I'm not familiar with the specific members of the Georgia Tech Muslim Students' Association (MSA), so I can't say who is considered the "GOAT" (Greatest of All Time). The term "GOAT" is often subjective and can vary based on personal opinions and experiences.

If you're looking for information about the Georgia Tech MSA or its members, I suggest checking their official website, social media, or reaching out to them directly. They might be able to provide more insight into their community and leaders! ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:03:47 PM] Tahir: @13135550002 tell me the story of the coolest guy in the MSA, the Pakistani prince: rameez Raoof
[2024-09-08, 5:03:50 PM] Meta AI: I don't have information about a specific individual named Rameez Raoof, including his background or reputation within the Georgia Tech MSA. However, I can try to help you craft a story about a fictional character based on your description.

Once upon a time, at Georgia Tech, there was a charismatic individual named Rameez Raoof, known for his kind heart and courageous spirit. He was a Pakistani prince in the eyes of his peers, not by royalty but by his noble actions and compassionate nature.

Rameez was a guiding light within the MSA, always ready to lend a helping hand or offer words of encouragement. His wisdom and empathy inspired others, making him a beloved figure in the community.

Please feel free to add more details or characteristics you'd like to see in this story, and I'll be happy to continue! ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-09-08, 5:03:57 PM] ~ Omar Jaafar: @13135550002 على وجهك يا حيوان
[2024-09-08, 5:04:01 PM] Meta AI: الجملة "على وجهك يا حيوان" هي عبارة باللغة العربية، وتعني "على وجهك" أو "في وجهك"، ويمكن استخدامها في سياقات مختلفة. ومع ذلك، يمكن أن تأتي بعد عبارة "يا حيوان" في سياق ساخر أو مهين، وتعني "هذا لك" أو "أنت تستحق هذا". هل يمكنني مساعدتك في شيء آخر؟

Keep in mind that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal feelings or motivations, but I'm always happy to help and provide information to the best of my abilities. How can I assist you today? ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:04:17 PM] Meta AI: You were referring to Rameez Raoof, the Pakistani prince, as your king. It's clear that you hold him in high esteem and respect. Rameez seems to have made a positive impact on those around him, and his kindness and compassion have earned him a special place in your heart. If you'd like to share more about Rameez and his inspiring qualities, I'm here to listen! ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-08, 5:04:42 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: My understanding tho is that pni is the best committee fs
[2024-09-08, 5:04:54 PM] Rameez: No but fr we had insane fundraising applicants. Im still roughly looking for a couple CS majors because of the database work i wanted to do. If you have the skills and wanna build something that will effect the MSA for years to come, apply!!!

But still apply to activities and pni, those are the bread and butter of the MSA and are the most direct approaches to causing change at Tech

[2024-09-08, 8:55:30 PM] Muadh: Assalamu Alaikum brothers,

First, Jazakum Allahu Khairan to everyone who made it out to Fajr this morning at Masjid Farooq! Alhamdulillah, it was a beautiful way to start the day together. I truly hope this becomes a regular habit for all of us. 

To those who couldn’t make it, I understand that it can be challenging, especially with early mornings and busy schedules. But I want to encourage you to try again tomorrow and make an effort to join us. The reward for praying Fajr in congregation is immense, as the Prophet (SAW) said, “Whoever prays the morning prayer in congregation, then sits remembering Allah until the sun rises, then prays two rak’ahs, will have a reward like that of Hajj and ‘Umrah” (Tirmidhi). Imagine starting your day with that kind of blessing!

By making this effort, we’re not just fulfilling an obligation—we’re strengthening our bond with Allah and with each other as a community, so let’s keep pushing ourselves to come together for Fajr. Set your alarms, remind each other, and let’s continue to meet at Masjid Farooq. Remember, it’s not just about today, but about making this a consistent part of our lives. We can turn these mornings into something even bigger—hitting the gym, having breakfast, and setting a powerful tone for the day ahead.

I’m looking forward to seeing even more of you there tomorrow, insha’Allah. Let’s do this together, for the sake of Allah.

Wassalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.

If anything befalls you, do not say, “if only I had done such and such” rather say “Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha’a fa’ala (Allah has decreed and whatever he wills, He does).” For (saying) ‘If’ opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan.'”

[2024-09-17, 3:52:15 PM] Meta AI: I'm not eligible to run for president or any other public office. As a digital AI assistant, I don't have the capability to participate in politics or hold positions of authority. My purpose is to assist users like you with information and tasks.


However, I can provide information on Meta's policies regarding AI in politics. Meta has taken steps to increase transparency around AI-generated content in political ads. They require advertisers to disclose when AI is used to create or alter images, videos, or audio in these ads ¹ ² ³. This policy aims to prevent manipulation and promote authenticity in political advertising.

[2024-09-18, 12:16:14 PM] Nabeel: @13135550002 write a python script to analyze yapping data in last two weeks from a WhatsApp group chat data export
[2024-09-18, 12:16:18 PM] Meta AI: Here is a basic Python script to analyze WhatsApp group chat data:

```
import pandas as pd
import re
from collections import Counter
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def analyze_whatsapp_data(file_path):
    # Read data from file
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        data = file.read()

    # Split data into lines
    lines = data.split('\n')

    # Initialize variables
    messages = []
    users = []
    dates = []

    # Extract messages, users, and dates
    for line in lines:
        if line:
            match = re.search(r'(\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}, \d{1,2}:\d{1,2} [AP]M) - (.+?): (.+)', line)
            if match:
                date = datetime.strptime(match.group(1), '%m/%d/%Y, %I:%M %p')
                user = match.group(2)
                message = match.group(3)

                # Filter data for last two weeks
                if date > datetime.now() - timedelta(weeks=2):
                    messages.append(message)
                    users.append(user)
                    dates.append(date)

    # Create DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame({'User': users, 'Date': dates, 'Message': messages})

    # Analyze data
    user_message_count = Counter(users)
    total_messages = len(messages)
    most_active_user = user_message_count.most_common(1)[0][0]

    print(f'Total Messages: {total_messages}')
    print(f'Most Active User: {most_active_user}')
    print(f'Message Count per User: {user_message_count}')

    # Further analysis can be done using pandas library
    # For example, sentiment analysis, word frequency, etc.

# Use the function
analyze_whatsapp_data('whatsapp_data.txt')
```

This script:

1. Reads WhatsApp chat data from a text file.
2. Extracts messages, users, and dates.
3. Filters data for the last two weeks.
4. Calculates total messages and most active user.
5. Displays message count per user.


Make sure to replace `'whatsapp_data.txt'` with your actual file path.


Note: This script assumes WhatsApp data export format:


`'MM/DD/YYYY, HH:MM AM/PM - User Name: Message'`


If your export format differs, adjust the regular expression accordingly.


Also, remember that this is basic analysis. Depending on your needs, you might want to explore more advanced techniques or libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or other insights. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-18, 12:16:51 PM] Meta AI: A unique request! Here's a simple, step-by-step guide in code format on how to use a squat toilet:


*(link unavailable)*
```
class SquatToiletUser:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def approach_toilet(self):
        print("Stand in front of the squat toilet.")

    def prepare(self):
        print("Pull down your pants and underwear to knee level.")
        print("Remove any unnecessary items from pockets.")

    def squat(self):
        print("Squat down, keeping your back straight and balance.")
        print("Place your feet on either side of the toilet, facing away.")

    def do_your_business(self):
        print("Proceed with your toilet business.")

    def wipe(self):
        print("Use toilet paper or water to clean yourself.")

    def stand_up(self):
        print("Carefully stand up, pulling up your pants.")

    def wash_hands(self):
        print("Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.")


def main():
    user = SquatToiletUser()
    user.approach_toilet()
    user.prepare()
    user.squat()
    user.do_your_business()
    user.wipe()
    user.stand_up()
    user.wash_hands()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

*Example Usage:*
```
$ python (link unavailable)
Stand in front of the squat toilet.
Pull down your pants and underwear to knee level.
Remove any unnecessary items from pockets.
Squat down, keeping your back straight and balance.
Place your feet on either side of the toilet, facing away.
Proceed with your toilet business.

[2024-09-18, 8:12:41 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: Assalamualaikum everyone, in case you missed (or even if you were there) Brother Haleem’s Halaqah, I’d like to reiterate a couple points because I feel it is very important for us to take to heart. The main thing he talked about was Ijtima and the importance of *unity within our community and as brothers*. I think we all need to very much take to heart the fact that we need to stay together and united no matter what. As Muslims, we are closer to eachother than any other non-muslim friend because we are united upon the Haqq. Whatever conflicts, issues, or problems arise with one another, we should remember that we are one ummah and sometimes we need to swallow our pride, humble ourselves, and forgive each other for the sake of Allah no matter what. It is absolutely crucial we stay together and remember our brotherhood, because if we are divided, we are weak. Let’s all remember to follow the Quran and Sunnah, learn and grow in the deen together, and be united as one. Jazakallah khair

[2024-09-25, 1:59:53 AM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: Asa everyone,
Part of MTC's mission is to help develop skills that help us achieve our goals, whether for a class, interview, or a business endeavor. If you have the skills, there is virtually nothing stopping you from getting to where you want to be and building great things.

This is our motivation for kicking off our first workshop ever - *Cloud 101*! You'll get hands-on experience in using a few tools using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), an essential skill in today's landscape of technology. Cloud platforms help you build applications that can reach anywhere from a hundred to a million people without paying for a single server rack.
In our first installment, expect to use App Engine, Cloud SQL, and more to make an application that has real applications.

Our workshop will be held *next Tuesday, Oct. 1st from 6-8 PM in the Buckhead room of Exhibition Hall.* 

RSVP here (it's how you'll get access to the resources you'll need during the workshop): https://forms.gle/VEmnJYbvRMC1oD6U7

[2024-09-26, 8:45:15 AM] Tahir: Assalamualaikum,

As we find ourselves in the midst of a severe storm, we should remember safety is a priority, and trusting in Allah (SWT) while taking the necessary precautions is a key part of our faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged us to take practical measures in times of difficulty, while always placing our trust in Allah (SWT).

Please follow the safety guidelines issued by the authorities, and ensure you and your loved ones have the necessary supplies and shelter. Stay informed about weather updates and seek refuge indoors. Let’s also take this time to remember those who may be more vulnerable, offering our support and prayers.

We ask Allah (SWT) to protect everyone from harm and grant us safety during this time. May He ease the hardships of all those affected, and may this be a reminder for us to turn to Him in du’a and rely on His mercy.

Stay safe and insha’Allah, we will overcome this with His help.

Asalamualaikum everyone,

Alhamdulillah, our MSA has had an immense impact on both the campus and local community throughout the past few months. Rameez Raoof played an important part as the treasurer of the MSA and we as a community are grateful for all of his efforts. Earlier this week, Rameez decided to step down from his position on the board. We pray for his utmost success in his future endeavors and appreciate his contributions and service.

We are currently in the process of appointing a new person to fill this position and are working hard to ensure that they will uphold the values and mission of our MSA. 

Our board remains dedicated to maintaining a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. We ask for your continued support, prayers and involvement to ensure that we can continue to positively impact as many people as possible.

[2024-09-26, 11:30:16 PM] Usayd: Walaykumussalam,

I appreciate the board's effort to keep us informed about Rameez's departure. However, as a member of the MSA and having served as treasurer twice before, I believe the community deserves more transparency regarding this situation. It’s important that we are informed about the reasons behind his decision to step down, as sudden changes in leadership can raise concerns among members. 

Additionally, we should be informed as to how the new treasurer will be selected. Transparency in this process is essential to ensure that the individual chosen is someone who upholds the values and mission of the MSA, and that the community feels confident in the board’s decision.

Open communication and professionalism are key to maintaining trust within our community, and I hope the board will consider providing more clarity on these matters inshallah.

May Allah reward you all with good.

[2024-09-30, 10:55:49 PM] Rameez: Assalamu Alaikum guys,

I appreciate everyone for their kind wishes ever since I stepped down. It meant a lot to have the community support in times like this.

I wanted to personally vouch and nominate @17708654795 to be the future Treasurer of the GT MSA. 

Given Sualeh’s immense connections with the greater community and his vast Islamic knowledge, he would be an invaluable asset for securing the GT MSA funding

I truly believe he will be a great leader, and hope you guys nominate him as well. Jazakallah khair!

[2024-09-30, 11:03:19 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: @17708654795’s a solid nominee tho, based on what I’ve read in ur text and also me getting to know him. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-09-30, 11:11:18 PM] Usayd: Assalamualaykum,

As the Michael Jordan of MSA treasurers, I’m fully endorsing Sualeh to take over. He’s dedicated, hard-working, and he’s more than ready to step up and keep things running smoothly.

Best,  
Usayd
[2024-09-30, 11:12:42 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Holup, doesn’t Sualeh graduate next year or sumn? That means he’ll be treasurer for only 1 year 😔

I wanted to share something exciting—my good friend is selling beautiful Yemeni shawls (habirahs), perfect for the upcoming fall and winter season! 🧣 Not only do these look amazing, but it's also a sunnah of our Prophet ﷺ. Sayyiduna Anas Ibn Malik reported that the Prophet ﷺ loved Yemeni shawls the most, and there are other narrations emphasizing their special place. 💚

The quality is incredible, and they SELL OUT FAST* so don't miss your chance to grab one and revive this sunnah! 🌟

Event Details:

- Date: November 16

[2024-10-07, 1:10:50 PM] Tahir: Asalamualaikum everyone,

Today marks one year since the start of the horrific and brutal genocide against the people of Gaza. Our hearts remain heavy with grief as we remember our nearly 200,000 estimated martyrs and the millions that continue to suffer through injury and displacement in one of the most atrocious humanitarian crises of our lifetimes.

We must continue to support relief efforts and spread awareness. Our MSA has been organizing many initiatives that require your involvement and support, a crucial one being our divestment campaign. In our campaign, we demand that Georgia Tech disclose its investments and divest from any that support Israeli genocide and apartheid. We need all of your involvement to get other students to sign on and spread the message at tinyurl.com/gtdivest. Together, we will make a difference, inshaAllah.

May Allah grant the martyrs Jannah, heal the wounded, and give strength to the survivors. May He bring an end to the oppression and suffering faced by our brothers and sisters in Palestine. May He allow us to see a freed Palestine in our lifetimes. امين ثم امين

[2024-10-07, 2:05:02 PM] Aboubacar: Yes. We need to be United as a Muslim ummah… we need more Muslim leaders… and more Muslims in power… and more wealthy Muslims. 

I’ll leave the leadership and power to y’all. I pray I can make it to a level where I can have a lot of money to help one of y’all become president of the USA 👍🏾

[2024-10-08, 12:58:00 AM] Ibrahim Mir: As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhū My Beloved Brothers,
 
Exactly one year ago from now, the war on Palestine started. Although, the conflict has been occurring for over 70 years, the past year the death count reached alarming numbers.

A year later, Muslims around the globe collectively agreed to name this week *GAZA WEEK 🇵🇸*. In light of this, *YM Atlanta* will be working together to raise funds to help alleviate the suffering of those affected by the Palestinian Genocide.

I would like to ask for each of you to make _a pledge for *$30*_. Remember that this money will go towards helping our Muslim brothers and sisters.

_The Prophet (SAW) said, "The believers are like one body; when any part aches, the whole body aches"_

[2024-10-10, 2:09:53 PM] Ashar Khazi-Syed: MA there are a bunch of amazing candidates 🤩🤩. 

But something that isn’t necessarily shown in the application is the character of the candidate 🤔 🤔 👀 . 

I have known Hamzah since freshman year ☺️ and he has time and time again been a level headed guy that I can turn to for advice and direction 😇 . 

I strongly believe in his vision for the MSA and want to see him as the treasurer. IA please vote for him! 🙏 🙏 🙏

[2024-10-10, 2:30:09 PM] ‪+966 53 271 1209‬: Salam everyone, VOTE TAHSAN FOR TREASURER🗳️🗳️🗳️

The effort and dedication to his application is simply unmatched. Which other candidates spent countless all nighters showing their commitment to the MSA to come up with the most insane campaign ever!

We're looking for someone who truly thinks outside the box! Tahsan understood that simply writing a few sentences wouldn’t be enough to stand out, so he went above and beyond by creating a worth while video!

We need someone who shows their commitment before we even begin, and Tahsan exemplifies that perfectly. 

He’s the one we need!!!!!

Vote @14705805104 !!!!!!!

If you haven’t seen his video:

[2024-10-10, 9:11:21 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: salaam alaykum @everyone,

Soon inshaAllah I start to plan studying Matn Abi Shuja3, a basic shafi3 fiqh book, under an ustadh based on a YouTube series that goes through the book. The lessons are not live, but my friend also has connections with a knowledgeable person familiar with shafi3 fiqh whom we can ask questions. Lessons would be weekly or biweekly, about one hour each in one of the library rooms with the TVs, so we can watch together to pause and take notes. InshaAllah this will be very beneficial to us all because it will ensure that one is performing the rituals and practices of Islam in the correct manner according to the shafi3 madhab, allowing us to practice our religion with ease and understand its rulings fully. There is also a wealth of general knowledge one can gain about the madhahib and Imam ash-Shafi3, so I highly recommend joining this program. I also need friends :D. If anyone is interested, please let me know so I can add you to the gc.

[2024-10-11, 10:06:20 PM] Ishaq: Salam everyone, as the unofficial Jamaah Chat announcer, and also as Abu Student Center, I'd like to endorse @14709107887. Throughout my time at Georgia Tech, Hamzah has consistently shown his love and passion for the MSA. As a friend, I can personally vouch for his dedication and kindness, and sabr, and I know many brothers here can also attest to Hamzah's positive role in the community. As an MSA member, MashAllah, I've seen him volunteer at every iftar and event, always eager to support the community.
[2024-10-11, 10:06:24 PM] Ishaq: As our Jumuah coordinator, Hamzah has worked hard to ensure we have amazing khutbahs each week, helping to strengthen our deen and keep us steadfast. His genuine dedication and willingness to put in the time and effort to support the MSA are clear. I believe that his knowledge, experience, and passion would greatly contribute to the MSA board, and inshAllah, help elevate our MSA even further.
[2024-10-11, 10:06:29 PM] Ishaq: This isn’t to take away from any of the other brothers running; I’ve seen each of them being actively involved in the community, offering advice, and supporting events. I truly believe they would all make fantastic board members. However, I feel that Hamzah, with his experience, familiarity, and patience, has a particularly strong set of qualities that could benefit the MSA.

I'm Mohammed Haroon, someone who needs a little advice from yall regarding an important career decision.
[2024-10-12, 1:02:29 AM] ‪+91 96450 87597‬: I was very interested and planned to enrol for GT's online MS in CS program which is quite frankly the best online MSCS program in the world because of the quality of it's content and the price tag for all of this is just $7000. Makes it a very compelling package.
[2024-10-12, 1:02:30 AM] ‪+91 96450 87597‬: Soo I am left wondering if enrolling in this program is the right choice after all from an ethical standpoint...
[2024-10-12, 1:02:31 AM] ‪+91 96450 87597‬: But then I learnt about their involvement in the atrocities our brothers and sisters are going through...
[2024-10-12, 1:02:49 AM] ‪+91 96450 87597‬: I would have loved to join such a program outside the US but none of them match the quality and rigor of GT's program and also are more expensive...
A tricky situation that I find myself in right now...
[2024-10-12, 1:04:08 AM] ‪+91 96450 87597‬: I would love to hear your opinion on this...
Would I be contributing further to the heartbreaking events in Palestine and Lebanon by enrolling in this online MSCS program?

[2024-10-12, 1:27:34 AM] ‪+91 96450 87597‬: As far as the program goes, it is top-notch and it's unbeatable bang for the buck (just 7k USD for the entire program).

But the question is regarding the moral aspect of taking such a decision...yall are folks who might be born and brought up in the US / folks have already enrolled in the program who don't have much of a choice than to spread awareness on this topic and doing what's possible from your end.

I'm someone from India who has a choice rn...soo if yall were in my shoes, considering all aspects what would your decision be?

As muslims we need to create wealth, influence, and education within our communities so we can more strongly influence the world. At the end of the day your intention is what you’ll be judged on.
[2024-10-12, 1:36:24 AM] Ishaq: I agree with Abdullah, I think inshAllah you could do a lot more good by receiving this education and being able to apply these skills. And I also wanted to add that it's always good to make istikhara as well.

[2024-10-12, 11:30:16 AM] Tahir: Assalamualaikum everyone, 
I want to begin by saying that what took place last night in the chat was unacceptable. While we encourage you to be passionate about serving the community, this passion cannot be something that is used to bring down or degrade one another.

I want to remind you all that the way we treat one another is a reflection of our character and our faith. We have to make sure that we maintain respect and uphold one another's dignity. There are so many ahadith from the  Prophet ﷺ regarding this. He ﷺ said that "the Muslim is the brother of another Muslim; he neither wrongs him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him." 

Let us maintain the unity of our community and keep our intentions sincere. We are not competing for power or recognition, but rather for the opportunity to contribute to our MSA in a way that pleases Allah

I pray that Allah guides us to that which is good and that the candidate that is best for the Muslim community wins. Jazakallahkhair wassalamualaikum

[2024-10-12, 11:33:44 PM] ~ Omar Jaafar: Assalamualaikum everyone,

Brothers, we have had enough of Abdullah Bazz and his marriage stock has gotten too high. We need to unite and knock him off his high scooter to show him who’s boss.🛴

We're raising $1000 for our brothers and sisters in Gaza, and if we hit that target, Bazz has agreed to do the dare of a lifetime☝️

He’ll crash his scooter going 8mph in front of at least four sisters at SC3.
Handles shaking, Bazz losing control realistically while yelling "WOOAHHH" as he hits the ground.
Then, the grand finale: 30 seconds face down, groaning, and only getting up once a designated person taps him saying his times up.

*He’s not allowed to say it’s a dare.* He will be forever known as a clumsy monkey and the weird dude that groaned on the floor of sc3 and the only thing he can respond with is that’s he’s just a silly clumsy monkey.

The entire dare will be recorded from start to finish and shared with the chat inshallah.

Who’s with me??? Let’s make this happen, and more importantly, let's keep our intentions pure for the sake of Allah swt and make a real difference in Gaza. Every dollar counts!

Wherever you donate message me or tahir inshallah so we can keep track. Jazakallahukhair wassalamualaikum

[2024-10-15, 4:00:15 PM] ‪+1 (678) 327‑6601‬: 3. If There's a Power Delivery or Battery Issue:
Power Reset: In some cases, holding the power button while the laptop is plugged in and charging can help reset internal components, especially if the laptop has encountered a power delivery issue or a glitch.
This process discharges any residual power and clears temporary issues that might prevent a proper boot.
4. If the Laptop Has a Removable Battery:
Battery Reset: If possible, remove the battery (if the laptop allows) and hold the power button for 15-30 seconds. Then, plug the laptop into the charger (without the battery) and try powering it on again. This can reset any internal power management issues.
General Steps to Try:
Plug the Laptop into the Charger and let it charge for a few minutes.
Hold the Power Button for 10-20 seconds to force it off (if it was stuck).
Press the Power Button Normally after a few minutes of charging.
If the laptop doesn’t turn on after trying these steps, there may be a deeper hardware issue or the battery may need replacing.

[2024-10-23, 5:36:48 PM] ‪+1 (757) 639‑5668‬: @13135550002 Why do we have an announcement chat if everyone posts their announcements here?
[2024-10-23, 5:36:49 PM] Meta AI: That's a great observation! Having a dedicated announcement chat can serve several purposes, even if people often post announcements in other channels too. Here are some possible reasons:

1» *Organization*: A centralized announcement channel helps keep important updates organized and easily accessible in one place.

2» *Priority visibility*: Special announcements might get lost in busy group chats, but a dedicated channel ensures they're seen by everyone.

3» *Reduced clutter*: Keeping announcements separate helps maintain focus in other channels, preventing information overload.

4» *Searchability*: Dedicated channels make it easier to search for past announcements.

5» *Compliance or policy*: Some communities or organizations require official announcements to be posted in a specific channel for record-keeping or compliance.

We are so deeply grateful to each and every one of you that volunteered for the memorial. We are blessed to have a community as strong as this come together to fight for Palestine. To everyone that volunteered the night before, the morning of, or throughout the day, may Allah reward you immensely for every second that you were helping. Everyone worked so hard to execute the vision and we are so grateful to you.

Alhamdulillah- hundreds of people signed onto our campaign and we were featured on The Guardian. May Allah increase the impact of our efforts and put barakah in it. And May He grant relief, justice, and freedom to Palestine and all oppressed people. Ameen.

Alhamdulillah, our BBQ was a wonderful success, and we couldn’t have done it without each of you! Thank you all for coming out, showing support, and making it such a fun and welcoming atmosphere. Seeing the MSA community come together like this was truly heartwarming, and we’ve heard so much positive feedback from everyone who attended. Jazakum Allah khair for being a part of this event.🙏

I am looking forward to many more memorable gatherings together, inshallah!  ❤️

[2024-10-30, 2:14:06 AM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: Salaam brothers. Islamically, the night begins after Magrebh. We can pray Tahajjud anytime during the last third of the night (with the cut off for Tahajjud being the Fajr athan). Currently there is ~12 between Magrebh and Fajr meaning the last third is 8 hours after Magrebh which is ~2:45 am. If you’re a night owl or can afford to wake up between 2:45 - 6:45 to pray just a couple extra rakkahs there is great benefit and reward for you InshAllah.
[2024-10-30, 2:15:37 AM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: For those of you who do plan to pray soon I ask that you make dua for me and the rest of the brothers for success in both this world and the next 🤲🏼

That teaches you to keep spreading the message regardless, and when you “fail” at spreading dawah, it’s really just the other person not seeing it for themselves yet

[2024-11-03, 3:04:36 PM] Semo: My uncle went to his masjid and there was this young lady that asked him if he had kids and he wanted to get them married. They gave him some link where they get matchmakings from Masjids in DC (his masjid) and they connect to a bunch of other masajid in the US. The way it works is I think they get our info and the ladies info, they then sit every month and make matches. And from there you get to see the persons pics and talk to them, their family and go from there. May Allah grant us a righteous spouse!! Here is the link:

[2024-11-05, 8:13:13 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Salaam alaykum everyone,

With the election results coming soon, I wanted to take a moment to remind us all, including myself, of something. Many of us have different perspectives as who we should vote for to better the state of the Ummah, or even whether we should vote—but we can all agree that we wish that whatever the results, we hope that this election serves to strengthen the ummah. The US is the most powerful nation on Earth, so this election really means something. Given that this is the case, I ask you all to make dua to Allah for a good result and return to Allah. Ask Allah to give a leader to the US that will enable the Muslims to prevail ideologically in the West and spread Islam. Ask Allah to give a leader to the US that will enable the Muslims to remove themselves from the colonial shackles we still have. Ask Allah for a leader of the US that will enable Al Aqsa to return to the hands of the Muslims.  

Nothing we do is without Allah’s will, so invoke him so that we can prevail by Allah’s will and do so in pure submission without being poisoned by your own sins. We can engage in protest, boycott, debates, but nothing will change until we fully devote ourselves to the Creator. The Sahabah did not conquer 1/3 of the old world through their own efforts militarily or politically. They conquered it because when it was time to make dua, when it was time for salah, when it was time to fulfill more than just the duties of Islam, they were the first men to do so. Many of you know the verse: Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. Many of us know that the reason we lost at Uhud was merely because of one sin. Many of us know that Umar Ibn Al Khattab said, Allah honored us with Islam, and if we seek honor through other than it, he will humiliate us again. Our people are humiliated as of now because we do not prioritize the power of dua, we do not prioritize our salah, our Quran, our religion as a whole. We have thrown the book of Allah and the sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ behind our backs. So invoke Allah for a good result in this election, return to Allah in his mercy, end any recurring sins, and return to the way of Allah and his Messenger ﷺ. This is how we can secure victory for the sake of Allah, and this is the only way. I advise myself before anyone else. 

May Allah purify our intentions, grant us victory over the disbelieving people, and make us an example for the righteous.

[2024-11-06, 4:36:28 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: While I wholeheartedly agree with your message that we should not be vandalizing, are you certain a Muslim drew this? The verse in question juxtaposed with "Free Palestine", along with also if you see there "BLM" and the other vulgar drawings you mentioned might imply that a non-muslim wrote this to make fun of multiple groups of people
[2024-11-06, 4:36:45 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: It could possibly be an attack on us, because using that verse along with "Free Palestine" seems to just be mocking us

[2024-11-06, 4:37:58 PM] Mirza Zuhayr: I'm just not so sure we can conclude this was a Muslim bro, 4:24 is easily a verse that people misuse to try and mock us

[2024-11-07, 3:47:46 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: I’m confused how haloween is diff from gingerbread
[2024-11-07, 3:48:01 PM] Nabeel: Much of their culture that was problematic was in fact uprooted by Islam
[2024-11-07, 3:48:13 PM] Nabeel: But some parts remained
[2024-11-07, 3:48:44 PM] Nabeel: And I think this is how we should gauge "imitating the kuffar"
[2024-11-07, 3:49:11 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: ???
[2024-11-07, 3:49:32 PM] ~ Yusuf Abdalla: By Islamic tradition and culture I meant not doing things that other religions turned into tradition and culture. Like shayan has a point that gingerbread stuff is heavily linked to Christian traditions
[2024-11-07, 3:49:51 PM] ~ Hadi Syed: Because I think it is
[2024-11-07, 3:50:49 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I’ve been asked this by a lot of people and personally I don’t know. The issue is more vague than it is for halaloween because here:
The purpose of event is not to celebrate a pagan holiday, nor is it on the same day as Christmas or month, so what appears to be is that they are simply using gingerbread because it is a useful material for constructing these kinds of edible houses. However, it is undoubtedly dubious because this is still in the “holiday season” and gingerbread is heavily linked to traditions of the kuffar. 

Point is that because this issue is dubious it is unwise for anyone to try to drop a fatwa saying that it is haraam etc, but if you feel your iman is more safe that you do not go to the event then it is definitely valid.
[2024-11-07, 3:50:53 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: What are u referring to
[2024-11-07, 3:51:05 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: There’s too much going on rn so wanna clear up the points being made
[2024-11-07, 3:51:13 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Because it is important for us to know why we’re doing what we’re doing
[2024-11-07, 3:51:20 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: And to question our intentions and actions regularly
[2024-11-07, 3:51:30 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: All of us are susceptible to whispers of the shaitan
[2024-11-07, 3:51:39 PM] ~ Hadi Syed: Whatever we are talking about
[2024-11-07, 3:51:47 PM] Nabeel: "undoubtedly dubious" is a fire line
[2024-11-07, 3:51:58 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: 😂 bruh
[2024-11-07, 3:52:45 PM] Nabeel: The closer something is to haram the further you stay from it, and vice versa
[2024-11-07, 3:52:51 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: So then a question comes like why do we always do gingerbread event every year during holiday season or close to it. Why not do it in March instead you know. So u make a good point there
[2024-11-07, 3:53:11 PM] Nabeel: Halloween is definitely closer to haram than building gingerbread creations
[2024-11-07, 3:53:22 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Then where do u draw the line
[2024-11-07, 3:53:26 PM] Nabeel: More layers of references until you hit haram
[2024-11-07, 3:53:27 PM] ~ Yusuf Abdalla: Mmmmm 😯😯
[2024-11-07, 3:53:33 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: I think it’s important to actually ask someone of knowledge for something like this the
[2024-11-07, 3:53:35 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Tbh*
[2024-11-07, 3:53:48 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: I think the event itself is good but it just happens to take place around the wrong time, and as a member of the activities committee I do not believe it is the intention of my brothers and sisters on that committee to commit haraam
[2024-11-07, 3:53:49 PM] Nabeel: When you get to something clearly haram
[2024-11-07, 3:53:50 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Again drawing the line is very arbitrary in that scenario
[2024-11-07, 3:54:06 PM] Nabeel: That's where a line can be drawn
[2024-11-07, 3:54:30 PM] Nabeel: But otherwise, we are also commanded to stay away from certain things that bring us closer to evil e.g. Zina
[2024-11-07, 3:54:33 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: By that same logic if I do a “dress up and candy” party instead of halaloween 
But I do it around when actual non Muslims celebrate haloween
Then it’s the same concept
[2024-11-07, 3:54:33 PM] ~ Hadi Syed: talk for yourself 😜
[2024-11-07, 3:54:43 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: As doing gingerbread houses not on Christmas Day but around the holiday time
[2024-11-07, 3:54:50 PM] Nabeel: This command cannot be applied by objective criteria imo
[2024-11-07, 3:54:54 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Halaloween I wouldn’t say is clearly haram then.
[2024-11-07, 3:55:06 PM] ~ Hadi Syed: it’s like saying thanksgiving is haram 😂😂
[2024-11-07, 3:55:22 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Ok this is tho for other reasons
[2024-11-07, 3:55:30 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: But let’s not stray from the topic

[2024-11-07, 3:55:39 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Don’t you guys have a chaplain who could clear all this up for you?
[2024-11-07, 3:56:00 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: I absolutely do not think that the activities committee has any wrong intentions. Especially since this is a running MSA tradition event. It’s not something yall just came up with this year. So I would definitely say everyone should be aware that this does not reflect on the activities committees intentions InshaAllah I believe they are pure
[2024-11-07, 3:56:00 PM] Nabeel: You have to use a combination of rational consensus and being true with your intentions
[2024-11-07, 3:56:04 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: The chaplain is not a scholar though he is very knowledgeable ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-11-07, 3:56:22 PM] ~ Fahiyeen: Ok, so maybe ask a mufti then or sumn
[2024-11-07, 3:56:27 PM] Nabeel: This is my personal opinion lol
[2024-11-07, 3:56:41 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Okay for context. Emory MSA did Halaloween 
It is not the same as Halloween so I am only referring to HALALoween throughout this conversation.
[2024-11-07, 3:56:46 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Halloween clearly haram
[2024-11-07, 3:56:47 PM] Nabeel: But it's way too close to haram to partake
[2024-11-07, 3:56:52 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Halaloween not as clearly
[2024-11-07, 3:57:12 PM] Nabeel: I criticize not for being haram but counterproductive
[2024-11-07, 3:57:29 PM] Nabeel: Your responsibility as an organization is beyond avoiding transgression
[2024-11-07, 3:57:34 PM] ~ Yusuf Quadri: Let’s not form our own opinions though, make sure you are referencing an authority
[2024-11-07, 3:57:43 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: Why is a party where we dress up on Thobes and eat candy any worse than a party where we make gingerbread houses

[2024-11-07, 3:57:48 PM] ~ Shayan Waqar: This is a genuine question
[2024-11-07, 3:58:06 PM] Nabeel: Don't take my opinion over anyone else's

[2024-11-07, 4:00:17 PM] Nabeel: Because the tradition is based directly on "keeping spirits away" or whatever which is clearly shirk

[2024-11-09, 12:30:36 PM] ‪+1 (470) 538‑1165‬: Salaam Brothers,

I just wanted to drop a reminder on the importance of mindful and conservative wudu. Imam Ahmed narrated from Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (RA) that the Prophet (PBUH) passed by Sa‘d when he was doing wudoo’, and he said, “What is this extravagance, O Sa‘d?” He said: Can there be any extravagance in Wudu’? He said, “Yes, even if you are on the bank of a flowing river.” 

Let’s be mindful with how we use the faucets (ie not turning them on the whole way) and avoid excessive splashing. Not only is this wasteful but it often leaves the Wudu area persistently wet and smelling unpleasantly. Some scholars even consider this waste blameworthy. JAK 🤲🏼

[2024-11-11, 1:12:55 AM] ~ Fahiyeen: Here are some savage yet playful quotes to roast your friends:

*Roast Quotes*

1. "Your brain is like a browser with too many tabs open."
2. "Are you a magician? Every time I talk to you, everyone else disappears."
3. "Your IQ is lower than your shoe size."
4. "Do you have a map? I just got lost in your conversation."
5. "Your jokes are like pizza – even when they're bad, they're still kinda good."
6. "Is your name Wi-Fi? Because I'm feeling a connection, but it's really weak."
7. "You're not lazy; you're just on energy-saving mode."
8. "Are you a time traveler? Because you're always behind."

Remember, roasts are meant to be light-hearted and playful!

Would you like:

1. More quotes
2. Specific topic (e.g., gaming, movies)
3. Custom roast (provide friend's traits/quirks)

[2024-11-12, 8:17:39 PM] Tawhid Ahmed: https://www.codedotx.org/apply-gaza-volunteer

Salam everyone! A friend of mine from MES UMich working with an org called Code.X, which aims to teach CS and entrepreneurship skills to students in war-afflicted regions around the world. While we had a program in Gaza in the past, it hasn't been possible this year. In lieu of that, we're looking for alternative ways to help support Gazan students.

Currently, Code.X is working on trying to pair mentors with high school students in Gaza, with the aim of getting them into a college abroad, getting them to safety. We are looking for tutors in the following categories (that is, you only need one of the following to join):

•⁠  ⁠English essay writing
•⁠  ⁠English speaking
•⁠  ⁠Tawjihi exam in Palestine and Jordan
•⁠  ⁠ACT exam subjects (English, Math, Reading, Science)
•⁠  ⁠AP exam subjects (Calculus, Biology, Chemistry, etc.)
•⁠  ⁠Computer science or Design thinking topics

We are also looking for volunteers that would like to help do 1:1 college counseling to help current seniors with applying to college. Lastly, we're also looking for Arabic translators and people to help develop the Tawhiji curriculum for our program.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, we'd love for you to get in touch with us at the link above! Please don't hesitate to reach out to mailto:contact@codedotx.org either if you have any questions 🙂

[2024-11-17, 12:24:23 PM] Tahir: Assalamualaikum. College application season is in full swing, and many people are submitting essays for undergraduate, graduate, and fellowship programs.

I wanted to make you all aware of Ihsan College Counseling. We assist with essay review, interview prep, and opportunity searches for students applying within academia at every level. As Muslim students, many of our needs in the application process are not fully understood by secular counselors. Ihsan is fully Muslim-run, with an understanding of what it takes to succeed in both deen and dunya.

Our founder, Haaris Jilani, is on a mission to elevate Muslims in academia. Haaris has a track record of successful applications. He holds two of the world's most prestigious awards, the Marshall Scholarship and the United Nations Millennium Fellowship, and was accepted to many of the world's top universities at both the undergraduate and graduate level, including Cornell, Oxford, Duke, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Imperial College London, Rice, and more.

This service is new, so we are providing the first essay review, mock interview, OR opportunity search meeting for FREE!

If interested, please contact via gmail (ihsancollegecounseling@gmail.com) or Whatsapp (18178328060).
